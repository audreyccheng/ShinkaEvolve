# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Deterministic Iterative Re-weighting**: The **Current Best Program (Generation 90)** replaces randomized restarts with a deterministic "Virtual Weight Boosting" strategy. By identifying the heaviest pack after a greedy pass and multiplying the virtual weights of its items by 1.05 (`virtual_weight * 1.05`), the algorithm forces these difficult items to be allocated earlier in the next iteration. This achieved the optimal balancedness score of 0.31, matching the performance of massive random searches (e.g., **Generation 96**) with greater stability.
- **Unified Hierarchical Packing**: The **Current Best Program** efficiently reuses the generic `balanced_packing` function for both the logical-group-to-node and replica-to-GPU mapping stages. This confirms that the load balancing problem is self-similar across hierarchy levels, and a robust LPT+Refinement solver works universally, unlike specialized logic attempted in earlier generations.
- **Vectorized Broadcasted Swap Refinement**: Consistent across all top performers (**Generations 90-93, 95-99**) is the use of tensor broadcasting to compute swap deltas. The pattern `w_max_items.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(2) - w_all_items.unsqueeze(3)` allows the evaluation of every possible 1-item swap between the bottleneck pack and all other packs in a single vectorized operation, enabling exhaustive local search without runtime penalties.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Feedback-Driven Adaptive Replication**: **Generation 94** attempted to dynamically increase replica counts for experts assigned to bottleneck GPUs based on initial packing feedback. This resulted in a slightly lower combined score (0.65) compared to the baseline (0.66). The added complexity of modifying the replication logic based on packing results proved less effective than the standard D'Hondt method followed by strong swap refinement.
- **Unstructured Massive Randomization**: While effective at reaching the baseline, programs relying solely on massive parallel random restarts (**Generation 96** with 128 restarts, **Generation 91**) did not surpass the 0.31 balancedness ceiling. This indicates that simply increasing the volume of random configurations provides diminishing returns compared to the targeted, feedback-driven heuristics of the **Current Best Program**.
- **Aggressive vs. Subtle Reweighting**: Comparing **Generation 90** (Best Program) with previous failure **Generation 85**, the magnitude of reweighting is critical. **Generation 85** failed (score 0.18) with a "Two-Pass" aggressive bias, whereas **Generation 90** succeeded (score 0.31) using a gentle 5% cumulative boost. This suggests that reweighting must preserve the general "large items first" property of LPT while only slightly altering the sorting order of similarly sized items.

## Implementation Insights
- **Optimal Vectorized Local Search**: The **Current Best Program** demonstrates the most efficient pattern for MinMax refinement in PyTorch. By constructing a metrics tensor of shape `[L, M, G, G]` (Layers, Packs, Group_Max, Group_Other), it computes the resulting max load for all possible swaps in one step. The use of `masked_fill_` to exclude invalid swaps (self-swaps) and `torch.min` to find the best move ensures the operation remains fully GPU-resident.
- **In-Place Tensor Mutation**: To maintain a Speed Score of 1.0 during iterative refinement, the **Current Best Program** modifies `pack_indices` and `pack_weights` in-place (`pack_weights[...] -= d_val`). This avoids the significant overhead of allocating new tensors inside the optimization loop (10-50 iterations), which is a common bottleneck in slower implementations.
- **Vectorized D'Hondt Method**: The `replicate_experts` function in the **Current Best Program** implements the Jefferson/D'Hondt apportionment method using `scores = weight / logcnt` and `torch.argmax`. This stateless, vectorized approach ensures mathematically optimal replica distribution without the branching logic seen in earlier rounding-based attempts.

## Performance Analysis
- **Universal Saturation at 0.31 Balancedness**: Every valid program in this batch (**Generations 90-99**) converged to a balancedness score of exactly ~0.31. This strongly suggests a structural "hard wall" in the evaluation dataset, likely caused by a specific large indivisible item (or expert group) that determines the theoretical minimum max load. No amount of randomization or heuristic variation has broken this limit.
- **Speed Score Uniformity**: All programs achieved a perfect Speed Score of 1.0. This confirms that modern PyTorch vectorization is extremely capable for this problem size; the difference between running 10 smart iterations (Gen 90) versus 128 random restarts (Gen 96) is negligible in runtime, shifting the focus entirely to algorithmic quality.
- **Deterministic vs. Randomized Equivalence**: The performance data shows that the deterministic **Iterative Re-weighting** (Gen 90) and **Massive Randomized Restarts** (Gen 96) yield identical results (0.31/1.0). However, the deterministic approach is preferred for reproducibility and debugging, validating it as the superior architecture despite the score tie.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program** and the identification of a performance ceiling at 0.31 balancedness, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Vectorized 2-for-1 Swap Refinement**
    The current 1-for-1 swap logic often deadlocks when a large item in the heaviest pack is roughly equal to the sum of two items in a lighter pack. Extend the `_refine_minmax` function to support **2-for-1 swaps** by constructing a tensor of pair-sums for the lighter packs (`weights.unsqueeze(1) + weights.unsqueeze(0)`) and broadcasting this against the single items of the heaviest pack. This $O(M \cdot G^2)$ operation can resolve structural imbalances that single swaps cannot.

2.  **Variance-Based All-Pairs Descent**
    The current local search only targets the `max_load` pack, which can get stuck if no direct move improves the global maximum. Introduce an **All-Pairs Variance Reduction** phase that iterates over random pairs of packs (not just the max one) and performs swaps that reduce the sum of squared loads ($\sum \text{load}^2$). This smooths the distribution of "intermediate" packs, creating new geometric configurations that unlock previously impossible moves for the bottleneck pack.

3.  **Feedback-Driven Replica Apportionment**
    The current iterative strategy only re-weights items for the packing order. Extend the feedback loop to the **replication phase**: if a specific logical expert consistently ends up in the max-load GPU, artificially boost its "score" in the `replicate_experts` D'Hondt allocation for the next iteration. This forces the allocation of an extra replica to that expert, reducing its per-instance weight and directly shrinking the bottleneck.

4.  **Lookahead Greedy Initialization**
    The current LPT heuristic places items in the currently lightest bin without regarding future consequences. Enhance the `balanced_packing` initialization with a **1-step Lookahead**: when placing item $k$, evaluate candidate bins by tentatively simulating the optimal placement of item $k+1$. Choose the bin for $k$ that minimizes the projected imbalance after $k+1$ is placed, preventing the greedy process from filling bins needed for subsequent large items.

5.  **Hierarchical Post-Hoc Repair**
    The strict separation of Node-level and GPU-level packing can lead to permanent imbalances if one node is assigned a "spiky" set of experts. Implement a **Global Repair** step that runs after the full allocation: if the global max-load GPU and global min-load GPU reside on different nodes, attempt to swap a high-level **Group** (logical expert cluster) between their parent nodes. This re-equalizes the node-level baselines before a final round of GPU refinement.
