# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Dual-Sided Flow Verification:** The **Current Best Program (Generation 58)** achieved the highest recorded combined score (0.93) and counter accuracy (0.931) by enforcing flow constraints from both ends of a link. Unlike previous iterations that relied solely on the local router's balance, Generation 58 calculates a `local_hint` (from the local router's conservation) and a `remote_hint` (from the peer router's conservation). This "pincer movement" constrains the traffic rate even if link symmetry is unreliable, significantly outperforming **Generation 55** (Score 0.85).
- **Consensus-Based Constraint Application:** Programs that treat flow conservation as a voting member in a consensus mechanism (**Generation 58**, **Generation 51**, **Generation 49**) consistently outperformed those that tried to "synthesize" or calculate rates directly from residuals. **Generation 58** uses flow hints as targets to weigh against measurements, whereas **Generation 54** attempted to mathematically derive rates from neighbors, resulting in error propagation and a catastrophic score of 0.16.
- **Selective Topology verification:** **Generation 55** and the **Current Best Program** explicitly identify "Verifiable Routers" (where all interfaces are monitored) before the repair loop. By generating flow hints only from these fully observed nodes, the algorithms prevent partial data in unmonitored network segments from generating false error signals, a technique that improved calibration to >0.83 compared to **Generation 46** (0.69).

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Direct Residual Synthesis:** **Generation 54** attempted to generate "synthetic candidates" by calculating the exact values needed to satisfy flow conservation and substituting them. This approach failed (Score 0.16), as it treated flow conservation as a hard calculator rather than a soft constraint, causing measurement errors from one link to propagate destructively across the topology.
- **Rigid/Uniform Confidence Scoring:** **Generation 49** achieved excellent counter repair accuracy (0.923) comparable to the best program but failed in calibration (0.552). Its "Trust-Weighted" system likely assigned uniformly high confidence to all flow-derived repairs without distinguishing between those verified by *both* symmetry and flow versus those verified by flow alone.
- **Heuristic-Only Consensus:** **Generation 53** relied on a "Weighted Invariant Consensus" that blended signals without a strong flow-based arbiter. This resulted in mediocre counter accuracy (0.61) because it lacked the structural "physics" of the network (conservation laws) to break ties in complex conflict scenarios.

## Implementation Insights
- **Dual-Hint Resolution Logic:** The **Current Best Program** implements a `resolve_direction` function that accepts both a `local_hint` and a `remote_hint`. The code explicitly models the remote router's perspective: `h = max(0.0, rb_r['rx'] - (rb_r['tx'] - peer_val))`. This implementation detail allows the algorithm to validate a local RX value using the remote router's structural constraints on the peer's TX value.
- **Decision-Tree Calibration:** Instead of continuous decay functions, the **Current Best Program** uses a hard-coded decision tree in its `calibrate` function. It assigns specific probabilities based on verification depth: `1.0` for Flow+Symmetry match, `0.90` for Flow correction, `0.95` for Symmetry-only, and `0.30` for unverified conflicts. This granularity allowed it to achieve a calibration score of 0.921.
- **State-Aware Iteration:** The **Current Best Program** updates the state dictionary in-place (`state[i_id]['rx'] = vals['rx']`) within the iterative loop. This Gauss-Seidel style update allows the improved accuracy from a "Dual-Sided" fix on one link to immediately improve the flow balance calculations for adjacent links in the same pass.

## Performance Analysis
- **The Calibration Barrier:** High counter accuracy is necessary but not sufficient for a top score. **Generation 49** reached 0.923 accuracy but stuck at 0.85 total score due to poor calibration (0.552). **Generation 58** matched that accuracy (0.931) but achieved a 0.93 total score by effectively predicting its own reliability (Calibration 0.921). The leap comes from knowing *when* the repair is right.
- **Consensus vs. Synthesis:** There is a stark performance gap between "Voting" and "Calculating". Approaches that used flow constraints to vote or guide consensus (**Generation 50, 51, 55, 58**) consistently scored >0.85. Approaches that tried to calculate missing values directly from constraints (**Generation 54**) crashed to <0.20. Network repair requires probabilistic consensus, not algebraic substitution.
- **Symmetry vs. Flow Reliability:** **Generation 46** (Score 0.65) relied heavily on symmetry, which faltered when sensors diverged without strong flow hints. **Generation 58** (Score 0.93) proved that Flow Conservation is the stronger arbiter, specifically when applied from both ends of the link (Dual-Sided) to override misleading symmetry data.
