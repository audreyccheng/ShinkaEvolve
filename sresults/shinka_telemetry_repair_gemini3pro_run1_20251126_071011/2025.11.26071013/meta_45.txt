# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Discrete Confidence Bucketing via Verification Tiers:** The **Current Best Program** achieved the highest calibration score (0.858) by abandoning continuous error-based decay in favor of strict discrete tiers. It assigns `0.98` for values verified by both local and remote flow constraints, `0.95` for local-only verification, `0.85` for heuristic repairs (e.g., zero-to-active), and `0.6` for unverified guesses. This approach outperformed **Generation 30** and **Generation 31**, which struggled with continuous functions (Calibration ~0.55).
- **Flow Conservation as a Binary Vote (Arbiter):** High-performing programs like **Generation 40**, **Generation 35**, and the **Current Best Program** (Score 0.86) utilize flow conservation errors to cast "votes" (0.0 for valid, 1.0 for invalid) rather than using the raw error magnitude to weigh values. This "winner-take-all" logic prevents large errors from one faulty sensor from dragging down correct measurements via averaging.
- **Topology-Aware Constraint Application:** The **Current Best Program** and **Generation 40** explicitly calculate a set of `verifiable_routers` (routers where all interfaces are monitored) before the repair loop. Flow conservation constraints are only strictly enforced on these routers. This prevents partial data in unmonitored segments from generating false error signals, a specific improvement over **Generation 37** (Score 0.582 on counters), which failed to robustly handle partial topologies.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Virtual Interface and Residual Synthesis:** **Generation 34** attempted to model unmonitored links as "virtual interfaces" to balance flow, resulting in the lowest combined score (0.35) and poor counter accuracy (0.203). Similarly, **Generation 44**'s "Residual Synthesis" (Score 0.60) failed to reliably reconstruct traffic. These methods introduce unconstrained variables that drift significantly from ground truth.
- **Continuous Error-Based Confidence Decay:** Programs like **Generation 30** and **Generation 31** applied linear penalties to confidence based on residual flow errors. This proved ineffective (Calibration < 0.55) because small residuals in complex topologies do not correlate linearly with the probability of correctness; a binary "verified/unverified" distinction is far more predictive.
- **Strict Pre-requisites for Hints:** **Generation 37** required fully monitored routers to generate *any* flow hints. This overly strict requirement prevented the algorithm from using valid peer symmetry data in partial network segments, leading to mediocre counter repair accuracy (0.582) compared to the robust 0.86 of the **Current Best Program**.

## Implementation Insights
- **Gauss-Seidel State Propagation:** The **Current Best Program** updates the state dictionary immediately within the iteration loop (`state[if_id]['tx'] = new_val`), allowing flow corrections to propagate to adjacent links in the same pass. This contrasts with batch-update approaches, enabling faster convergence for the iterative consensus logic.
- **Voting Logic for Noise Masking:** The **Current Best Program** implements a `get_vote` helper that returns `0.5` (neutral) when a router is not verifiable. This implementation detail effectively masks noise from partial data, ensuring that only fully observed nodes contribute to the decision-making process between conflicting peer measurements.
- **Strict Pipeline Phases:** The most effective implementations (**Current Best**, **Generation 36**) strictly separate **Status Repair** (based on traffic heuristics) from **Rate Repair**. By finalizing status first and forcing `down` interfaces to zero rates, they prevent the rate optimization loop from wasting cycles trying to balance noise on inactive links.

## Performance Analysis
- **Calibration-Accuracy Convergence:** The **Current Best Program** successfully unified high counter accuracy (0.855) with high calibration (0.858). Previous high-accuracy attempts like **Generation 42** (Accuracy 0.83) suffered from lower calibration (0.78). The bridge was the shift from continuous scoring to discrete, logic-based confidence assignment.
- **Impact of Constraint Hardness:** Approaches that treated flow conservation as a "hard" constraint for voting (**Generation 35**, **40**, **Current Best**) consistently scored ~0.86. Approaches that treated it as a "soft" target for synthesis or weighted averaging (**Generation 34**, **44**) scored significantly lower (0.35 - 0.60), confirming that network repair benefits from discrete decision boundaries rather than blending.
- **Status Repair Solved:** Across almost all recent generations (30-44), Status Repair has consistently hit 1.00. The differentiation now lies entirely in Rate Repair accuracy and Confidence Calibration, where the **Current Best Program** leads by handling unobservable network segments with neutral voting rather than guessing.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the successful implementation of discrete confidence tiers and strict flow conservation in the **Current Best Program**, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Continuous Gradient Voting for Tie-Breaking**
    Refine the internal `get_vote` function to return a continuous penalty (e.g., `flow_error / FLOW_TOLERANCE`) instead of a binary `0.0` or `1.0` score. While the *final confidence* benefits from discrete buckets, the *repair logic* loses information when treating a 0.1% error and a 4.9% error as identical. A continuous score allows the algorithm to prioritize the mathematically superior candidate even when both satisfy the baseline constraints.

2.  **Virtual Interface Inference for Partial Topologies**
    Expand the `verifiable_routers` definition to include routers with exactly *one* unmonitored interface. Calculate the specific "virtual rate" required on that missing interface to satisfy flow conservation (Sum In = Sum Out). If this virtual rate is physically plausible (non-negative), use it to strictly validate the observed links, effectively extending the "island of truth" into partially monitored segments of the network.

3.  **Residual Imputation for "Double-Dead" Links**
    Implement a synthesis branch for scenarios where a link reports near-zero traffic on both ends, but the local router exhibits a large flow surplus (Input >> Output). In these cases, selection-based repair fails because both candidates are wrong. Instead, inject the router's residual surplus as a candidate rate for the link, transforming the strategy from "selection" to "synthesis" for blocked flows.

4.  **Transitive Confidence Propagation**
    Introduce an intermediate confidence tier (e.g., `0.93`) for links that are not locally verifiable but connect to a router that *is* strictly verified and balanced. Currently, such links fall into a generic heuristic bucket (`0.85`) or a low-confidence guess (`0.6`). Explicitly recognizing that trust propagates from verified nodes to their immediate neighbors will improve calibration for the network periphery.

5.  **Magnitude-Adaptive Constraint Tolerance**
    Modify the `FLOW_TOLERANCE` to scale dynamically with traffic volume, applying tighter constraints (e.g., 1-2%) to high-bandwidth core routers and looser constraints (e.g., 8-10%) to low-traffic edge nodes. This prevents timing jitter on small, noisy flows from casting "invalid" votes, while enforcing rigorous consistency where it matters most for the global score.
