# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the individual program summaries (Generations 30-39) and the provided code for the current best program (Generation 31), here are the specific insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Linearized Binary Search + Asymmetric ILS**: The top-performing program (Generation 31, Score 41.43) and strong contenders (Generation 36, Score 39.80) utilize a binary search to find an optimal parameter $K$ for a linearized objective ($Load + K \cdot Size$), followed by Iterated Local Search. This initialization consistently outperforms standard greedy sorting by placing the search in a better basin of attraction.
- **Bi-Directional Asymmetric Swaps (1-2 and 2-1)**: While previous bests focused on 1-to-2 swaps, Generation 31 achieves the highest score (41.43) by implementing *both* **Swap 1-2** (moving 1 item from bottleneck to dest, receiving 2) and **Swap 2-1** (moving 2 items from bottleneck, receiving 1). This flexibility allows the algorithm to resolve fragmentation regardless of whether the bottleneck is caused by a single large model or multiple small ones.
- **Lexicographical Vector Optimization**: Generation 31 and Generation 36 utilize a lexicographical comparison of the pressure vector `(max_kvpr, 2nd_max_kvpr, ...)` rather than just minimizing the maximum. This drives the local search to balance the *entire* cluster, preventing the "ping-pong" effect where reducing one peak simply creates another of equal magnitude.
- **Heuristic Neighborhood Pruning**: The best program drastically improves efficiency (0.026s) by restricting the Local Search source candidates to the **top 4 highest-pressure GPUs** and destination candidates to the **least loaded GPUs**. This focuses optimization efforts solely on relieving bottlenecks.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Symmetric High-Order Swaps (2-2)**: Generation 38 implemented **Swap 2-2** operators but plateaued at a score of 26.23. The evaluation suggests that 2-2 swaps are computationally expensive and do not effectively address the primary fragmentation modes (which are asymmetric), unlike the 1-2 and 2-1 moves used in the higher-scoring programs.
- **Pure Steepest Descent without Perturbation**: Generation 33 (Score 26.23) utilized a steepest descent approach that only accepts improvements. Without the "ruin-and-recreate" perturbation mechanism found in ILS approaches (like Gen 31's random model kick), the algorithm becomes trapped in

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 31) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Stochastic Multi-Start Initialization**
    Capitalize on the extremely fast execution time (0.026s) by wrapping the **Linearized Binary Search** initialization in a multi-start loop (e.g., 10-20 iterations). in each iteration, apply small random noise (e.g., $\pm 5\%$) to the calculated item weights ($w = load + K \cdot size$) before packing. Select the starting configuration that yields the best initial lexicographical vector, increasing the probability of landing in a superior basin of attraction.

2.  **Steepest Descent (Best Improvement) Selection**
    Shift the Move and Swap 1-1 operators from a "First Improvement" strategy (accepting the first valid better neighbor) to a "Best Improvement" strategy (scanning all neighbors for the bottleneck GPU and picking the best one). While computationally heavier, this ensures that every modification to the bottleneck GPU is optimal, preventing the algorithm from taking "greedy but short-sighted" steps that hinder global convergence.

3.  **Ruins-and-Recreate Perturbation**
    Replace the current single-item "Guided Kick" with a destructive Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator. When local search stagnates, completely remove **all** models from the highest-pressure GPU and re-distribute them to other GPUs using a Best-Fit Decreasing logic (allowing temporary infeasibility or forcing moves). This provides a sufficiently large perturbation to escape the deep local optima found at the 41.43 score level.

4.  **Tabu Search Memory**
    Implement a short-term cyclic memory (Tabu list) that records the last 5-10 moves as `(model_id, original_gpu_id)` tuples. Prevent the Local Search from reversing these moves for a set number of iterations. This simple mechanism effectively prevents the "ping-pong" cycling behavior observed in high-pressure clusters where two GPUs simply swap load back and forth.

5.  **Expanded Scope for Asymmetric Swaps**
    The current best program restricts the powerful **Swap 2-1** operator (moving 2 items out, taking 1 in) to only the single worst GPU (`sources[:1]`), whereas other operators scan the top 4. Expand the scope of the Swap 2-1 operator to the top 3-4 bottleneck GPUs. Secondary bottlenecks often lock the system; resolving fragmentation there can create the necessary space to relieve the primary bottleneck.
