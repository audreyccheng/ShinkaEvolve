# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the individual program summaries, previous insights, and the code of the current best program (Generation 27), here are the specific insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Linearized Binary Search Initialization**: The most effective programs (Generation 27, 29, 23) transform the non-linear KVPR objective into a linear bin packing problem (`load + K*size <= K*Capacity`) and solve for the optimal `K` using binary search. This consistently produces a superior starting baseline compared to standard greedy heuristics, enabling scores of 38-40+.
- **1-to-2 Swap Operator**: The specific inclusion of the 1-to-2 swap operator (swapping one item from the bottleneck GPU with two items from a target GPU) is a critical factor in breaking the ~26.23 score plateau. Generation 27 (Score 40.10) and Generation 25 (Score 39.22) utilize this to effectively resolve memory fragmentation where a large model is blocked by multiple small models.
- **Guided Perturbation**: While previous bests used random perturbation, Generation 27 (Score 40.10) refines this by implementing a "guided kick." Instead of moving a model to any random feasible GPU, it filters for the top 3 destinations with the *lowest* current pressure. This helps the algorithm escape local optima while maintaining a relatively balanced system state.
- **Hybrid Multi-Start Initialization**: The best program (Generation 27) generates multiple candidate starting states using both the Binary Search Linearization *and* several greedy heuristics (sorted by size, load, density), then selects the best one. This ensures the local search begins from the most promising basin of attraction.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **High-Order Swaps (2-1, 2-2) without Effective Initialization**: Programs like Generation 24 and Generation 26 implemented complex 2-1 and 2-2 swap neighborhoods but stalled at scores of ~26.23-26.25. Without the high-quality starting placement from the linearized binary search, these computationally expensive operators could not converge to the global optimum within the iteration limits.
- **Pure Greedy Descent**: Approaches relying solely on hill-climbing (accepting only improvements), even with advanced operators (Generation 26), failed to match the performance of ILS approaches. The data clearly shows that the ability to accept temporary degradation (via perturbation) is required to jump from ~27 to ~40.

## Implementation Insights
- **Cached Objective Metrics**: The current best program (Generation 27) uses a `GPUState` class that explicitly caches `_cached_kvpr` and `_cached_rem`. This prevents the expensive floating-point division required for the objective function from being recomputed during the thousands of trial moves in the inner loop, maintaining an execution time of 0.032s.
- **Dynamic Constraint Linearization**: The initialization function in Generation 27 calculates item weights dynamically as `(req_rate / slo) + target_k * model_size`. This effectively collapses the multi-objective problem into a scalar weight for standard Bin Packing algorithms, controlled by the binary search parameter `target_k`.
- **Lexicographical Vector Optimization**: Successful implementations (Gen 25, 27) use Python's native tuple comparison on sorted pressure vectors: `tuple(sorted((g.kvpr() for g in gs), reverse=True))`. This ensures that the optimization process flattens the pressure distribution across *all* GPUs, rather than just ping-ponging the peak pressure between two bottlenecks.
- **Smart Perturbation Logic**: The specific coding pattern in Generation 27 for perturbation (`feasible_dests.sort(key=lambda g: g.kvpr()); target = random.choice(feasible_dests[:3])`) balances stochasticity (to break loops) with heuristic guidance (to avoid bad states), which appears to be the final optimization step needed to reach the 40.10 score.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 40.10 Ceiling**: There is a distinct performance tier at ~40.10 (Gen 27) compared to the previous best of ~38.38. The combination of Hybrid Initialization, 1-to-2 Swaps, and Guided Perturbation seems to be the optimal configuration for this problem instance.
- **Operator Specificity**: The evaluation results suggest that 1-to-2 swaps are significantly more effective than 2-to-2 swaps for this dataset. Generation 26 (using 2-2 swaps) scored 26.23, while Generation 27 (using 1-2 swaps) scored 40.10, indicating that the primary fragmentation mode involves single large models needing to displace multiple smaller fragments.
- **Efficiency of Advanced Methods**: Despite the complexity of ILS and Binary Search, the best program (Gen 27) runs in 0.032s. This is comparable to

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 27) and the successful patterns identified, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Randomized Multi-Start with Linearized Initialization**
    The current Binary Search Initialization is highly effective but deterministic. Leverage the fast execution time (0.032s) to run this initialization 10-20 times with stochastic variations. Specifically, introduce small random noise (e.g., $\pm 5\%$) to the item weights (`w = (req_rate / slo) + target_k * m.model_size * random_factor`) inside the `solve_linearized_bin_packing` function and select the best resulting configuration. This helps explore the "basin of attraction" around the optimal `K` parameter.

2.  **Steepest Descent Move Selection**
    Shift the local search strategy from "First Improvement" to "Best Improvement" (Steepest Descent). Instead of accepting the first move that reduces the pressure vector, scan all possible moves for the bottleneck GPUs and select the one that yields the *lexicographically smallest* vector. While computationally more expensive, the current speed margin allows for this aggressive optimization to ensure every step maximizes the gain.

3.  **2-to-2 Swap Operator**
    Re-introduce the **2-to-2 Swap** operator (swapping two items from a bottleneck GPU with two items from a target GPU). While this operator failed in earlier generations (Gen 26) due to poor initialization, it is now viable thanks to the superior starting states provided by the Linearized Binary Search. This operator can resolve complex fragmentation patterns where two medium-sized models block optimization.

4.  **Destructive Perturbation (Large Neighborhood Search)**
    Upgrade the perturbation logic from moving a single item (current "Guided Kick") to a "Ruins and Recreate" approach. When the local search stagnates, completely empty the bottleneck GPU (remove all its models) and re-distribute them into the remaining GPUs using a Best-Fit Decreasing heuristic. This provides a stronger "kick" to escape deep local optima at the 40.10 score level.

5.  **Tabu-Enhanced Search History**
    Implement a short-term Tabu list to prevent the algorithm from cycling between states. Store the last 5-10 moves (e.g., as `(model_id, previous_gpu_id)` tuples) and forbid the Local Search operators from reversing these moves immediately. This forces the algorithm to explore new areas of the search space before falling back to previous configurations, making the descent phase more efficient.
