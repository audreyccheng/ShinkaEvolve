# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 81-90 and the current best program (Generation 66), here are the extracted optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Linearized Constraint Initialization:** The most significant discriminator between low scores (~26) and high scores (>50) is the initialization strategy. Programs like **Gen 83 (Score 55.08)** and **Gen 85 (Score 57.36)** utilize a binary search to tune a scalar $K$ for the constraint `Load + K * Size`, effectively transforming the 2D packing problem into a 1D problem. This replicates the success of **Gen 66**, proving that geometric linearization is superior to standard sorting heuristics.
- **Lexicographical Vector Descent:** While Gen 85 achieved a high score of 57.36 by targeting bottlenecks, the **Current Best Program (Gen 66, Score 61.86)** outperforms it by optimizing the sorted tuple of all GPU pressures `(max_kvpr, 2nd_max, ...)`. This approach ensures that reducing the peak does not inadvertently create new, near-peak bottlenecks elsewhere, "smoothing" the entire cluster's load distribution.
- **Asymmetric Swap Operators (1-2 and 2-1):** High-performing programs (Gen 83, 85, 89) consistently implement swaps that exchange one large item for two smaller ones (and vice-versa). This is critical for handling model fragmentation and correcting cardinality mismatches that simple 1-1 swaps cannot address.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Heuristic Parameter Sweeping (The "26.26 Plateau"):** Programs like **Gen 81** and **Gen 82** applied sophisticated binary search and parameter sweeping techniques to standard "Best Fit Decreasing" or "Randomized Greedy" heuristics. Despite these efforts, they plateaued at scores around 26.26. This confirms that tuning the *wrong* algorithm (standard bin packing) cannot overcome the inherent non-linearity of the KVPR objective.
- **Feasibility-First Constraints:** Programs that achieved **100% success rates** (Gen 81, 82, 86, 90) consistently scored in the low tier (~26). In contrast, top performers like **Gen 66 (92% success)**, **Gen 83 (98%)**, and **Gen 85 (94%)** accept a small risk of failure. The evaluation data suggests that enforcing strict validity prevents the solver from exploring the dense, aggressive packing configurations required for scores above 50.
- **Greedy Bottleneck Reduction without Lookahead:** Gen 90 utilized a "Linearized Binary Search" but achieved only 26.23. The feedback suggests its search strategy or strict adherence to feasibility (100% success) likely pruned the high-quality, risky solutions that the linearized initialization generated.

## Implementation Insights
- **Tuple-Based Objective Comparison:** **Gen 66** leverages Python's native tuple comparison logic `tuple(sorted(kvprs, reverse=True))` to implement multi-objective optimization. This implementation detail allows the Local Search to automatically prioritize reducing the primary bottleneck, then the secondary, and so on, without complex custom comparator logic.
- **Dynamic Virtual Capacity:** The most effective implementation of linearization (seen in **Gen 66** and **Gen 85**) treats the problem as a "Virtual Capacity" problem. Instead of just sorting items, it solves `Load + K * Size <= K * GPU_CAP`. This effectively projects the 2D constraints onto a 1D line where the "price" of Size relative to Load is dynamically determined by the binary search parameter $K$.
- **Aggressive Neighborhood Pruning:** The best programs maintain high speed (0.03s - 0.05s) by limiting the search space. **Gen 66** explicitly restricts source candidates for moves/swaps to the **top 4 bottleneck GPUs**, making computationally expensive operators like `Swap 2-1` feasible within the tight time limit.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Linearization Gap":** There is a distinct performance discontinuity. Approaches using **Standard Heuristics** score **~26** (Gen 81,

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generations 81-90 and the strengths/weaknesses of the current best program (Generation 66), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Lexicographical Linearization Sweep**
    The current best program uses binary search to find the *minimum* feasible $K$, which effectively minimizes `Size` cost and creates the tightest possible packing. This often clumps items, creating spikes in Load. Modify the initialization to scan a range of feasible $K$ values (e.g., check 5 points between the minimum feasible $K$ and $1.5 \times K$) and select the starting configuration that yields the best **lexicographical vector**. This ensures the optimization starts from a "smoother" distribution rather than just a dense one.

2.  **Dual-Pivot (Source-Sink) Perturbation**
    Generation 66 currently "ruins" (empties) only the single worst bottleneck GPU. Extend this to simultaneously empty the **lowest-pressure GPU (Sink)** as well. This explicitely creates high-quality whitespace on the most underutilized resource, providing a guaranteed destination for the heavy items being displaced from the bottleneck during the "recreate" phase.

3.  **Capacity-Sum Pruning for Asymmetric Swaps**
    The `Swap 1-2` and `Swap 2-1` operators are computationally expensive ($O(N^3)$) and limit the search depth. Implement a fast geometric filter that only attempts these swaps if the total size of the items being moved in is within a tolerance window (e.g., $\pm 10\%$) of the items being moved out plus the destination's available slack. This prevents wasting CPU cycles on structurally impossible moves.

4.  **Adaptive "Troublemaker" Reweighting**
    Implement a feedback mechanism in the initialization: run the `solve_linearized_bp` solver once, identify the models residing on the GPU with the highest peak load, multiply their effective "weight" in the linearization formula by a factor (e.g., 1.1x), and re-run the solver. This forces the bin-packing heuristic to treat these specific bottleneck-causing items as "larger," naturally prioritizing their placement or isolating them from other heavy items.

5.  **Time-Bounded Randomized Fallback**
    To fix the current 8% failure rate (92% success), replace the single deterministic fallback with a **randomized FFD loop**. If the primary logic returns `None`, repeatedly execute First-Fit Decreasing with shuffled model orders until a valid solution is found or the time limit is reached. This ensures a valid (even if low-scoring) solution is always returned
