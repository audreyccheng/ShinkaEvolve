# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Network telemetry repair using link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass algorithm computes per-link TX↔RX deviations and repairs rates when violations exceed a 2% threshold by substituting the peer’s corresponding counter, adjusting confidence as 1−relative_diff; it enforces status consistency by lowering confidence on mismatches and zeroing counters for down interfaces reporting traffic. Returns per-field (original, repaired, confidence) and preserves metadata; flow conservation/topology lists are acknowledged but not applied.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs indicate the status consistency heuristic is effective, and confidence is reasonably calibrated; counter repairs are strong but could improve by incorporating flow conservation and fuller topology constraints beyond peer symmetry. The fixed 2% tolerance works, but adaptive thresholds and better handling of missing/unknown peers could enhance robustness and calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score ≈0.80 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.802, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.736.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repairs indicate the symmetry + flow-conservation strategy is effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, likely due to residual-based penalty scaling and assumptions for dangling links; tuning penalty weighting or handling incomplete topology could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name flow_informed_pairwise_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds unique interface pairs via connected_to, harmonizes status (traffic implies up), and enforces link symmetry using a 2% hardening threshold by averaging mismatched TX/RX pairs; down links are zeroed.

**Program Name: POCS-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iterative POCS alternates link-symmetry and router flow-conservation projections with damping (LINK_DAMP=0.6, ROUTER_DAMP=0.5) over 10 iterations, enforcing non-negativity and zeroing down interfaces. Status is harmonized via link-pair consistency and traffic evidence, and confidences blend change magnitude (0.55), router residuals (0.25), and link residuals (0.20) with a 2% hardening threshold.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.673; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.627).
- **Feedback**: Pairwise status reconciliation plus zero-traffic checks yielded perfect status accuracy, while damped projections provided stable but only moderate counter improvements. Confidence calibration was reasonable but could improve with smoother residual penalties or adaptive weights.

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise hardening using link symmetry (2% tolerance), averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, and harmonizes status via traffic evidence; then applies router-level flow conservation using a per-router shift (v' = v − s_tx + s_rx) and clamps non-negativity. Confidence scores start from 1−diff, are penalized by magnitude of applied changes, and further scaled by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces retain values with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68; counter_repair_accuracy 0.636, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.777.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate the link-symmetry thresholding and confidence penalties are well-tuned, while moderate counter repair suggests the averaging and balancing step could be refined to better correct rate mismatches. Effectiveness depends on accurate connected_to and router metadata, as these drive both pairwise reconciliation and router balancing.

Confidence is clamped and derived from relative mismatch; topology is merged with telemetry to complete router-interface maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status repair and strong counter corrections; confidence is reasonably calibrated but not perfect. The first-pass symmetry violation map is unused, and flow-conservation is only used to attenuate confidence, suggesting potential gains by using these signals to adjust values when safe.

- **Implementation**: Builds undirected peer pairs, harmonizes status, and reconciles A->B/B->A rates using dynamic relative thresholds, partial averaging with absolute guards, confidence floors, and change-magnitude penalties with geometric-mean harmonization on strong agreement. Handles dangling interfaces, computes per-router TX/RX residuals, applies gated/capped nudges to a dominating unpaired interface, and finishes with direction-aware residual penalties on confidences.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.85 (counter 0.834, status 1.000, confidence 0.887).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair stems from strict down enforcement and evidence-driven status alignment; confidence calibration is strong due to change-aware and residual-weighted scaling. Counter accuracy is solid but likely limited by conservative averaging thresholds and a micro-adjustment branch that can reduce the non-dominant counter, dampening imbalance correction.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name staged_consensus_repair - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Confidence Hardening**
- **Implementation**: Pairwise peer mapping enforces link symmetry via magnitude-aware gating (ABS_GUARD, LOW_RATE_CUTOFF) with partial-to-full averaging of tx/rx pairs; status consistency forces both ends down and reduces status confidence on mismatches. Confidence is calibrated via assigned values on adjustments and strong floors when within tolerance; flow conservation is referenced but not applied and the topology input is unused.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.86 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.912).
- **Feedback**: Symmetric fusion plus down-propagation delivers perfect status repair and well-calibrated confidences, while magnitude-aware guards avoid over-correcting tiny flows. Counter repair could improve by leveraging per-router flow conservation/topology and handling asymmetric loss or missing-peer scenarios.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name pairwise_partial_averaging_with_magnitude_gating - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses link-symmetry reconciliation with activity-weighted consensus, magnitude-aware thresholds (5% low-rate, 2% high-rate) and absolute guards; propagates down-status and zeroing, adds router-level micro-adjustments on unpaired dominant interfaces, and applies confidence floors plus direction-aware penalties/scaling.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.91 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.946; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.750).
- **Feedback**: Strong counter fixes and perfect status accuracy indicate effective directional consensus and status consistency logic. Confidence calibration trails likely due to aggressive floors (0.98–0.99), high default confidences, and softly clamped penalties (min 0.7), suggesting tuning the diff-to-confidence mapping and penalty strength.

**Program Name: Consensus-Residual Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses trust-weighted directional consensus with tolerance-based partial averaging and magnitude-aware guards, plus asymmetric confidence shaping with strong confidence floors and geometric-mean harmonization. Adds router-level micro-adjustments for dominating unpaired interfaces and direction-aware confidence penalties derived from flow-conservation residuals, with strict down-state propagation.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.91; counter_repair_accuracy 0.946; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.733.
- **Feedback**: Pairwise consensus and interface consistency logic drive perfect status recovery and strong counter repairs. Confidence calibration trails due to aggressive floors and guarded small-flow handling; softening floors or amplifying residual-based penalties could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name calibrated_confidence_guards - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Pairwise link-symmetry reconciliation uses activity-weighted consensus with magnitude-aware tolerances (2% for high rates, 5% for low), an absolute guard, and asymmetric confidence scaling; down-propagation zeros both sides. Router-level flow conservation applies capped (≤2%) micro-nudges to dominant unpaired interfaces and direction-aware confidence penalties, while in-tolerance agreements set high confidence floors.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.91 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.946, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.737.
- **Feedback**: Weighted consensus and strict status consistency yielded strong repair accuracy, but aggressive confidence floors and router-level penalties likely hurt calibration. Easing floors/penalties or refining scaling could better align confidence with actual correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name calibrated_confidence_penalties_and_magnitude_floors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses link-symmetry consensus with magnitude-weighted averaging, tolerance gating (low-rate cutoff and absolute guard), and partial-to-full convergence; enforces interface status consistency, applies confidence floors/assignments, and performs router-level flow-conservation micro-adjustments on dominating unpaired interfaces with direction-aware confidence penalties.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.91; counter_repair_accuracy 0.946, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.748.
- **Feedback**: Strong counter and status repairs show the invariants and pairwise consensus were effective. Confidence calibration lagged slightly, likely due to high confidence floors and conservative base clamps, suggesting tuning floors/penalties could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name weighted_consensus_and_router_residuals - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Consensus Router Balancer Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-stage repair: magnitude-aware directional link consensus with tolerance gating, activity-weighted partial averaging, and absolute guards, then router-balanced reconciliation that proportionally reduces the dominant side and mirrors adjustments to peers under a 3% residual trigger and 1.5% budget cap. Confidence blends direction-aware router residual penalties, link-symmetry fit, and correction magnitude with magnitude-aware floors and silent-side penalties; interfaces propagate down status to peers with zeroed rates.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95; counter_repair_accuracy 0.941, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.961.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation shows perfect status repair and well-calibrated confidences, indicating effective status enforcement and confidence shaping. High counter accuracy suggests the consensus step and bounded, mirrored router reconciliation improved symmetry and flow conservation without over-correcting.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name consensus_router_balancer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: POCS Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Alternating projections (POCS) enforce link-direction symmetry within tolerance bands and router flow conservation with non-negativity and pinned-down interfaces. Uses a closed-form equal-shift router LS step (c=delta/n) with peer mirroring, 4 iterations, and thresholds of 2%/5% relative, 0.5 Mbps absolute guard, 10 Mbps low-rate cutoff, and 0.1 Mbps quiet epsilon; confidences blend symmetry fit, router residuals, and change magnitude with direction-aware penalties and floors.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.62 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.620, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.510).
- **Feedback**: Strong repair and perfect status handling indicate the POCS and affine router balancing choices converge and enforce symmetry effectively. Confidence calibration trails, likely due to aggressive floors and weighting, suggesting tuning of symmetry floors, delta-penalties, and low-traffic shaping to better align confidence with actual error.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name pocs_affine_balancer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Symmetry and Conservation**
- **Implementation**: Builds undirected link pairs, harmonizes status via traffic evidence, and enforces magnitude-aware link symmetry using dynamic tolerances with guarded averaging; enforces router-level flow conservation by proportionally adjusting only dangling interfaces plus a conservative micro-adjustment. Confidence scores are penalized by change magnitude and scaled using local/remote router residuals.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined 0.85 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.887).
- **Feedback**: Status repairs are perfect, likely due to traffic-evidence up/down resolution and zeroing on down links; confidence calibration is strong from change-based penalties and residual scaling. Counter accuracy trails slightly, suggesting potential gains by tuning low-rate tolerances or refining router balancing under asymmetric bursts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 42 - Patch Name hodor_dynamic_hardening_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Consensus Router Balancer Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Three-stage repair: multiplicative pair-bias scaling via geometric-mean ratios with magnitude-aware gating, directional consensus using activity-weighted partial averaging, and router-balanced reconciliation that proportionally mirrors adjustments under residual triggers and capped budgets.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.940, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.955); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Flawless status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate robust gating and reconciliation choices; minor shortfall in counter repair suggests tuning ABS_GUARD/thresholds or router budget caps could further raise counter accuracy without sacrificing stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name pair_bias_scaling_stage0 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Consensus-Residual Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses trust-weighted directional consensus with partial averaging and magnitude-aware guards to align per-link tx/rx, applying confidence floors for in-tolerance agreements and asymmetric scaling when only one side shows traffic. Router-level micro-adjustments target dominating unpaired interfaces, and final confidences are composed from router residual penalties, link-symmetry fit, and correction magnitude, with geometric-mean floor harmonization and status floors under strong bilateral agreement.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.946, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.958); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong status repair and well-calibrated confidences suggest the gating, floors, and tri-axis composition are effective. Slight counter accuracy gap indicates potential gains by tuning consensus weighting/thresholds or the aggressiveness of router-level micro-adjustments.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Trust-weighted directional link consensus with magnitude-aware gating and partial-to-full averaging raised counter accuracy to 0.946
  - Present in the current best (“Consensus-Residual Network Telemetry Repair,” Gen 44: combined 0.95; counter 0.946; confidence 0.958) and the 0.91 cluster (Gen 33, 36–39: counter 0.946). These use 2%/5% tolerances, a 0.5 Mbps absolute guard, and activity-weighted consensus to align A.tx↔B.rx and B.tx↔A.rx.
- Tri-axis confidence composition delivers top calibration (≈0.955–0.961) without hurting counters
  - The current best (Gen 44, confidence 0.958) and “Consensus Router Balancer Telemetry Repair” variants (Gen 40: 0.961; Gen 43: 0.955) blend direction-aware router residual penalties, post-repair symmetry fit, and correction magnitude, with magnitude-aware floors and quiet-side penalties.
- Carefully bounded router reconciliation improves robustness while preserving counters
  - The current best nudges only dominating unpaired interfaces with α ≤ 2% (Gen 44; counter 0.946). Gen 40 mirrors proportional reductions to peers under a ~3% residual trigger and 1.5% cap (counter 0.941). Both maintain perfect status and top calibration.
- Status harmonization via traffic evidence and symmetric zeroing saturates status accuracy
  - All programs achieved 1.000 status_repair_accuracy by enforcing down propagation and zeroing both ends when resolved down (e.g., Gen 30–44).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Router-wide/global balancing (POCS or equal-shift LS) severely degrades performance
  - “POCS Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing” (Gen 41) drops to combined 0.62 (counter 0.620; confidence 0.510). Feedback notes convergence but overcorrection; this aligns with prior evidence that global router adjustments distort otherwise-correct counters.
- Over-assertive confidence floors and soft penalty clamps harm calibration
  - Gen 33 and Gen 36–39 all have strong counters (0.946) but poor calibration (≈0.733–0.750), citing aggressive floors (0.98–0.99), high default confidences, and softly clamped penalties (min ~0.7) that overstate certainty near thresholds.
- Conservative or misdirected micro-adjustments can blunt imbalance correction
  - “Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Residual Micro-Adjustments” (Gen 34, combined 0.85; counter 0.834) notes a micro-adjustment branch that can reduce the non-dominant counter, dampening effective imbalance correction and limiting counter accuracy.

## Implementation Insights
- Three-stage pipeline is key to top calibration and counters
  - The current best (Gen 44) runs: (1) pairwise consensus + status harmonization with magnitude-aware gating and floors; (2) apply adjustments; (3) recompute router residuals and compose confidences (tri-axis). This sequencing makes residual penalties reflect final values, boosting calibration to 0.958 versus ≈0.887 in earlier two-pass residual-scaling designs.
- Magnitude-aware guards prevent overcorrection on small flows while enabling decisive fixes
  - Dual thresholds (2% for high, 5% for low traffic), a 0.5 Mbps absolute guard, and quiet epsilon (~0.1 Mbps) are consistently used in high scorers (Gen 32, 35, 44), balancing stability and correction strength.
- Confidence shaping that reflects agreement strength and evidence asymmetry improves calibration
  - The current best combines in-tolerance floors, geometric-mean harmonization under strong bilateral agreement, asymmetric quiet-side penalties (e.g., 0.88 scaling when one side is silent), and direction-aware router residual penalties. This mix lifted calibration to 0.955–0.961 (Gen 40, 43, 44) versus ~0.733–0.750 when floors/penalties were mis-tuned (Gen 33, 36–39).
- Bounded router reconciliation strategies matter more than the act of adjusting
  - Adjusting only dominating unpaired interfaces (Gen 44) or mirroring with strict triggers/budgets (Gen 40) preserves high counters (0.946/0.941) and improves calibration, whereas unconstrained router-wide balancing (Gen 41) collapses both counter accuracy and calibration.

## Performance Analysis
- Two counter plateaus emerge: 0.834 and 0.946
  - The 0.85–0.86 cluster (Gen 30, 32, 34, 35) relies on conservative symmetry averaging and micro-nudges, yielding counter 0.834 with solid calibration (~0.887–0.912). The 0.91–0.95 cluster (Gen 33, 36–39, 44) uses trust-weighted consensus and sharper convergence, pushing counters to 0.946.
- Calibration differentiates strong-from-top combined scores at the high-counter plateau
  - With similar counter 0.946, mis-tuned confidence shaping

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Residual‑tilted, asymmetric consensus weights during pair repair
   - Precompute per‑router residuals on the original telemetry (before pairwise fusion) and use them to slightly tilt the trust‑weighted consensus toward the side that reduces the local router’s imbalance. For a->b, if sign((a_tx − b_rx) · (sum_tx_local − sum_rx_local)) > 0, shrink the local weight: w_a’ = clamp(w_a − γ, 0.1, 0.9), w_b’ = 1 − w_a’, with γ = min(0.08, 0.1 × resid_local). Keep all existing magnitude‑aware gating and partial averaging, but use w’ in place of w; this extends the proven trust‑weighted consensus that reached 0.946 counters while leveraging bounded, direction‑aware flow conservation without router‑wide balancing.

2. Improvement‑checked micro‑adjustments with stronger triggers and dominance test
   - Add a residual trigger and commit‑check for the dangling‑interface micro‑adjuster: require resid_frac ≥ 0.03 and the candidate interface to contribute >60% of the router’s absolute same‑direction imbalance (current 50%). Compute the tentative nudge (α as today, cap 2%), recompute the router residual, and only commit if it improves by at least 10% relative; otherwise skip. This tightens the “bounded reconciliation” strategy that preserved counters in Gen 40/44, reducing the chance of counter‑degrading nudges on noise.

3. Interface‑share–aware, direction‑coupled router residual penalties in tri‑axis confidence
   - When composing tx/rx confidences, modulate the local vs remote residual weights by the interface’s traffic share on its router: iface_tx_share = rtx / max(1, sum_tx_local), iface_rx_share = rrx / max(1, sum_rx_local). For tx: pen_tx = clamp(1 − ((0.6 + 0.2·iface_tx_share)·resid_local + (0.4 − 0.2·iface_tx_share)·resid_remote), 0, 1); analogously for rx using iface_rx_share. This extends the successful direction‑aware residual penalties that drove ~0.958 calibration by aligning penalty strength with the interface’s directional influence on conservation.

4. Asymmetric partial averaging near threshold to move the louder side more than the quiet side
   - In the partial averaging band (T < diff ≤ 2T), use different lerp factors for the two endpoints so the louder side moves more: let k_base = (diff − T)/T, loud = argmax(a_side, b_side). Apply k_loud = clamp(k_base·(1 + 0.5·loud_ratio), 0, 1) to the louder endpoint and k_quiet =
