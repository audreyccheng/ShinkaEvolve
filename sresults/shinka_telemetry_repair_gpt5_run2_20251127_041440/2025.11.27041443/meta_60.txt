# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Network telemetry repair using link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass algorithm computes per-link TX↔RX deviations and repairs rates when violations exceed a 2% threshold by substituting the peer’s corresponding counter, adjusting confidence as 1−relative_diff; it enforces status consistency by lowering confidence on mismatches and zeroing counters for down interfaces reporting traffic. Returns per-field (original, repaired, confidence) and preserves metadata; flow conservation/topology lists are acknowledged but not applied.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs indicate the status consistency heuristic is effective, and confidence is reasonably calibrated; counter repairs are strong but could improve by incorporating flow conservation and fuller topology constraints beyond peer symmetry. The fixed 2% tolerance works, but adaptive thresholds and better handling of missing/unknown peers could enhance robustness and calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score ≈0.80 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.802, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.736.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repairs indicate the symmetry + flow-conservation strategy is effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, likely due to residual-based penalty scaling and assumptions for dangling links; tuning penalty weighting or handling incomplete topology could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name flow_informed_pairwise_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds unique interface pairs via connected_to, harmonizes status (traffic implies up), and enforces link symmetry using a 2% hardening threshold by averaging mismatched TX/RX pairs; down links are zeroed.

**Program Name: POCS-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iterative POCS alternates link-symmetry and router flow-conservation projections with damping (LINK_DAMP=0.6, ROUTER_DAMP=0.5) over 10 iterations, enforcing non-negativity and zeroing down interfaces. Status is harmonized via link-pair consistency and traffic evidence, and confidences blend change magnitude (0.55), router residuals (0.25), and link residuals (0.20) with a 2% hardening threshold.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.673; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.627).
- **Feedback**: Pairwise status reconciliation plus zero-traffic checks yielded perfect status accuracy, while damped projections provided stable but only moderate counter improvements. Confidence calibration was reasonable but could improve with smoother residual penalties or adaptive weights.

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise hardening using link symmetry (2% tolerance), averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, and harmonizes status via traffic evidence; then applies router-level flow conservation using a per-router shift (v' = v − s_tx + s_rx) and clamps non-negativity. Confidence scores start from 1−diff, are penalized by magnitude of applied changes, and further scaled by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces retain values with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68; counter_repair_accuracy 0.636, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.777.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate the link-symmetry thresholding and confidence penalties are well-tuned, while moderate counter repair suggests the averaging and balancing step could be refined to better correct rate mismatches. Effectiveness depends on accurate connected_to and router metadata, as these drive both pairwise reconciliation and router balancing.

Confidence is clamped and derived from relative mismatch; topology is merged with telemetry to complete router-interface maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status repair and strong counter corrections; confidence is reasonably calibrated but not perfect. The first-pass symmetry violation map is unused, and flow-conservation is only used to attenuate confidence, suggesting potential gains by using these signals to adjust values when safe.

- **Implementation**: Builds undirected peer pairs, harmonizes status, and reconciles A->B/B->A rates using dynamic relative thresholds, partial averaging with absolute guards, confidence floors, and change-magnitude penalties with geometric-mean harmonization on strong agreement. Handles dangling interfaces, computes per-router TX/RX residuals, applies gated/capped nudges to a dominating unpaired interface, and finishes with direction-aware residual penalties on confidences.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.85 (counter 0.834, status 1.000, confidence 0.887).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair stems from strict down enforcement and evidence-driven status alignment; confidence calibration is strong due to change-aware and residual-weighted scaling.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Trust-weighted, magnitude-aware directional consensus with partial-to-full averaging
  - Current best program (Combined 0.95; counter 0.946; confidence 0.958) blends activity-based weights (w_a, w_b), dual tolerances (2% for high-rate, 5% for low-rate), a 0.5 Mbps absolute guard, and asymmetric partial averaging near thresholds with full convergence when diff > 2×tol. Similar patterns appear in “Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair” (Gen 53, counter 0.946; confidence 0.958) and “Tilted Asymmetric Consensus Telemetry Repair” (Gen 48, counter 0.941; confidence 0.959).
- Tri-axis confidence composition with direction-aware router residual penalties, symmetry fit, and correction magnitude
  - Current best composes confidences as 0.45×router-penalty + 0.35×post-repair symmetry-fit + 0.20×change-magnitude, with magnitude-aware floors (0.97/0.98/0.99) and quiet-side penalties (0.88). This matches top-calibration variants: Gen 53 (confidence 0.958), Gen 52 (0.959), Gen 48 (0.959), and Gen 56 (0.953).
- Tightly bounded router micro-adjustments restricted to dominant unpaired interfaces
  - The current best applies α ≤ 2% only to the dominating dangling interface and only in the direction that reduces imbalance, selected via a dominance check (contrib ≥ 0.5×|imbalance|) and α scaled by residual fraction. This preserves high counter accuracy (0.946) while matching top calibration. Variants with improvement-gated micro-adjustments also score highly (e.g., Gen 53) but can leave small residuals.
- Status harmonization via down-state propagation and zeroing
  - Strict bilateral down-channel zeroing and status consistency saturate status_repair_accuracy at 1.000 across all strong submissions (e.g., Gen 45–59).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Over-conservative consensus/guards that under-correct mismatches
  - Multiple programs in the 0.85 cluster (e.g., Gen 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 54, 57, 59) maintain perfect status and decent calibration (~0.882–0.887) but plateau at counter_repair_accuracy 0.834. Feedback consistently cites cautious thresholds/absolute guards and partial-move logic that under-correct, especially on low-rate links.
- Improvement-gated micro-adjustments that block beneficial R1 correction
  - While stabilizing, strict improvement gates and caps can leave residual imbalances, slightly depressing counters: Gen 48 (≥10% improvement gate) at counter 0.941 and Gen 58 at 0.939, versus 0.946 in the current best without an explicit improvement gate (but with dominance and α-scaling).
- Fragile pipeline/integration that collapses all metrics
  - “Pairwise Link Hardening with Router-Calibrated Confidence” (Gen 55) regressed catastrophically to a combined score of 0.02 (counter 0.023; status 0.033; confidence 0.026) despite a seemingly standard approach. This indicates that miswiring of the repair/assembly/confidence stages or misapplied gating can sink all three metrics.
- Global router balancing (from prior evaluations) remains harmful
  - Earlier “POCS Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing” (Gen 41) dropped combined to 0.62 (counter 0.620; confidence 0.510), confirming that unconstrained router-wide adjustments distort otherwise-correct counters and harm calibration.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective
  - Directional consensus details: activity-weighted blending, asymmetric partial averaging k = (diff − tol)/tol near threshold, and full convergence when violations are clear. Dual tolerances (2%/5%) with a 0.5 Mbps guard provide magnitude awareness without overcorrecting tiny flows.
  - Tri-axis confidence construction: per-direction router penalties weight local vs remote residuals asymmetrically (TX: 0.6 local + 0.4 remote; RX inverted), combined with post-repair symmetry fit and change-magnitude penalties. Magnitude-aware floors (0.99 for near-perfect high-rate symmetry; otherwise 0.98/0.97) and quiet-side 0.88 damping reflect evidence strength.
  - Router micro-adjust targeting: select only unpaired, up interfaces; compute contribution = |tx − rx|; require dominance (≥50% of router imbalance); α = min(2%, 0.5×residual_fraction); adjust only the larger of rx/tx to reduce the router imbalance. This avoids touching paired links and preserves link symmetry gains.
  - Sequencing matters: plan and apply pairwise adjustments first, then compute router residuals on the repaired values, and finally compose tri-axis confidences. This sequencing aligns residual penalties with final counters, boosting calibration to ~0.958 versus ~0.882–0.887 in earlier two-pass residual-scaling designs.
- Concrete coding patterns repeated in top performers
  - Absolute guard + low-rate cutoff constants (ABS_GUARD=0.5 Mbps, LOW_RATE_CUTOFF=10 Mbps) appear across the best-scoring programs (Gen 48, 53, 56, current best).
  - Strong floors only under strong agreement: 0.99 for ≤0.5% diff at high rates; 0.98/0.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Residual‑tilted, direction‑aware consensus weights in pair repair
   - Before pairwise fusion, compute each router’s signed residual on original telemetry. For a->b (a_tx vs b_rx), if (a_tx − b_rx) and the local router’s imbalance have the same sign, slightly tilt the activity weights to reduce the local residual: w_a’ = clamp(w_a − γ, 0.2, 0.8), w_b’ = 1 − w_a’, where γ = min(0.08, 0.1·resid_local). Apply only when diff > tol and |a_tx − b_rx| > ABS_GUARD; use w’ in place of w to keep the proven consensus but add bounded flow‑conservation awareness.

2. Asymmetric partial averaging that moves the louder side more
   - In the partial band (tol < diff ≤ 2·tol), replace a single k with k_loud/k_quiet so the louder endpoint moves more toward consensus. Let k_base = (diff − tol)/tol, loud = argmax(a_side, b_side), quiet = the other, and r = (loud − quiet)/max(1.0, loud); set k_loud = clamp(k_base·(1 + 0.5·r), 0, 1) and k_quiet = clamp(k_base·(1 − 0.5·r), 0, 1). Update new_loud = loud·(1 − k_loud) + consensus·k_loud and new_quiet analogously; this preserves current behavior when r≈0 but accelerates convergence when one side dominates.

3. More decisive low‑rate convergence with a dynamic absolute guard
   - For pairs with max(a_side, b_side) < LOW_RATE_CUTOFF, lower the full‑convergence trigger from 2·tol to 1.6·tol and use a slightly aggressive ramp k’ = ((diff − tol)/tol)^1.2 in the partial band. Also make the absolute guard magnitude‑aware: ABS_GUARD_low = 0.3 Mbps for low‑rate pairs and keep 0.5 Mbps otherwise, still requiring both relative and absolute triggers. This targets the documented under‑correction on low‑rate links without changing high‑rate stability.

4. Interface‑share–aware, direction‑coupled router residual penalties in confidence
   - Modulate the local vs remote residual weights by the interface’s directional share on its router before composing the 0.45/0.35/0.20 confidence blend. For tx: iface_tx_share = rtx/max(1, sum_tx_local), use weights w_local = 0.6 + 0.2·iface_tx_share and w_remote = 0.4 − 0.2·iface_tx_share; for rx invert the roles (local uses 0.6 + 0.2·iface_rx_share on the remote residual). This keeps the successful tri‑axis structure and floors but aligns penalties with each interface’s influence on conservation.

5. Safer, benefit‑checked micro‑adjustments on dominant unpaired interfaces
   - Keep the current dominance pick but add two guards: require resid_frac ≥ 0.03 and the candidate interface’s max(tx, rx) ≥ LOW_RATE_CUTOFF to avoid nudging tiny flows. Compute the tentative nudge (α = min(0.02, 0.5·resid_frac)), recompute the router residual, and only commit if it improves by ≥8% and does not increase the interface’s internal |tx − rx| beyond 3% relative; optionally allow a second mini‑step (extra α ≤ 0.01) if the first improved ≥20% and resid_frac remains ≥0.04. This preserves the strong counter accuracy of the current best while preventing counter‑degrading nudges seen in stricter or ungated variants.
