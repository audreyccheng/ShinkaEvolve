# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Network telemetry repair using link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass algorithm computes per-link TX↔RX deviations and repairs rates when violations exceed a 2% threshold by substituting the peer’s corresponding counter, adjusting confidence as 1−relative_diff; it enforces status consistency by lowering confidence on mismatches and zeroing counters for down interfaces reporting traffic. Returns per-field (original, repaired, confidence) and preserves metadata; flow conservation/topology lists are acknowledged but not applied.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs indicate the status consistency heuristic is effective, and confidence is reasonably calibrated; counter repairs are strong but could improve by incorporating flow conservation and fuller topology constraints beyond peer symmetry. The fixed 2% tolerance works, but adaptive thresholds and better handling of missing/unknown peers could enhance robustness and calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score ≈0.80 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.802, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.736.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repairs indicate the symmetry + flow-conservation strategy is effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, likely due to residual-based penalty scaling and assumptions for dangling links; tuning penalty weighting or handling incomplete topology could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name flow_informed_pairwise_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds unique interface pairs via connected_to, harmonizes status (traffic implies up), and enforces link symmetry using a 2% hardening threshold by averaging mismatched TX/RX pairs; down links are zeroed.

**Program Name: POCS-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iterative POCS alternates link-symmetry and router flow-conservation projections with damping (LINK_DAMP=0.6, ROUTER_DAMP=0.5) over 10 iterations, enforcing non-negativity and zeroing down interfaces. Status is harmonized via link-pair consistency and traffic evidence, and confidences blend change magnitude (0.55), router residuals (0.25), and link residuals (0.20) with a 2% hardening threshold.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.673; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.627).
- **Feedback**: Pairwise status reconciliation plus zero-traffic checks yielded perfect status accuracy, while damped projections provided stable but only moderate counter improvements. Confidence calibration was reasonable but could improve with smoother residual penalties or adaptive weights.

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise hardening using link symmetry (2% tolerance), averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, and harmonizes status via traffic evidence; then applies router-level flow conservation using a per-router shift (v' = v − s_tx + s_rx) and clamps non-negativity. Confidence scores start from 1−diff, are penalized by magnitude of applied changes, and further scaled by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces retain values with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68; counter_repair_accuracy 0.636, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.777.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate the link-symmetry thresholding and confidence penalties are well-tuned, while moderate counter repair suggests the averaging and balancing step could be refined to better correct rate mismatches. Effectiveness depends on accurate connected_to and router metadata, as these drive both pairwise reconciliation and router balancing.

Confidence is clamped and derived from relative mismatch; topology is merged with telemetry to complete router-interface maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status repair and strong counter corrections; confidence is reasonably calibrated but not perfect. The first-pass symmetry violation map is unused, and flow-conservation is only used to attenuate confidence, suggesting potential gains by using these signals to adjust values when safe.

  - The current best program (repair_network_telemetry) leads with combined 0.95 (counter 0.946; confidence 0.958; status 1.000) using 2% high-rate vs 5% low-rate tolerances, absolute guards (0.5 Mbps high-rate; 0.3 Mbps low-rate), activity-weighted trust (w_a, w_b), and low-rate-accelerated partial averaging (exp 1.2; full convergence at 1.6×tol low-rate, 2.0×tol high-rate). Close high performers mirror this: Gen 93 “Magnitude-aware Consensus Telemetry Repair” (0.94/0.940/0.905) and Gen 95/96/98/99 at 0.93–0.94 with counter ≈0.939–0.940 and confidence ≈0.904–0.906.
- Tri-axis confidence with share-aware, direction-coupled router penalties + post-repair symmetry fit + change magnitude
  - The best program’s 0.958 calibration blends router penalties (0.45) with symmetry fit (0.35) and change magnitude (0.20), using share-aware local/remote weighting and magnitude-aware floors (0.99/0.98/0.97) plus quiet-side damping (0.88). Gen 94 “Consensus-Residual Telemetry Repair with Pair-Bias” corroborates this design, reaching 0.954 calibration (combined 0.94; counter 0.926) with a similar tri-axis composition and floors/scales.
- Tightly scoped, benefit-checked router micro-adjustments on dominant unpaired interfaces
  - The current best confines R1 nudges to unpaired, up, high-rate, dominant interfaces, requires residual ≥3% and dominance ≥50%, caps α ≤2%, and commits only with ≥8% residual improvement and ≤3% internal-skew degradation, decreasing the adjusted direction’s confidence. This mirrors Gen 92 “Consensus Share-Aware Telemetry Repair” gating and preserves symmetry while improving balance.
- Strict status harmonization and down-state propagation
  - Near-universal status_repair_accuracy = 1.000 among top entries (Gen 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99). The best program enforces “down ⇒ zero traffic” and pair-consistent status, maintaining perfect status repair. Gen 90 (0.967 status) is a rare exception.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Global/iterative projection methods under-correct and miscalibrate
  - Gen 91 “Weighted Alternating Projections” scored 0.80 (counter 0.782; confidence 0.804): one-sided router reductions and conservative gating left imbalances unresolved. Gen 97 “Adaptive Global WLS” fell to 0.78 (counter 0.782; confidence 0.721): high confidence floors and in-tolerance trust produced overconfidence and weaker counter repair.
- Over-conservative gating and partial averaging depress counter accuracy
  - Gen 94 (combined 0.94; counter 0.926; confidence 0.954) and Gen 92 (0.89; counter 0.899; confidence 0.850) both cite conservative guards/unpaired penalties and strict micro-adjust triggers; these limit corrections, leaving residual asymmetries and lowering counter scores.
- Excessively tight or infrequently triggered router micro-adjustments limit R1 gains
  - Gen 98 “Hodor+” (0.93; counter 0.939; confidence 0.904) notes that dominant-step micro-adjustments are heavily guarded and may rarely fire, reducing router-balance improvements versus the current best’s benefit-checked yet effective scope.
- Confidence shaping that is too conservative or misaligned
  - Gen 95 “prescale_and_onesided_trust” and Gen 99 “prescale_and_one_sided_with_ultra_floor” (both confidence ≈0.906) use high floors and ultra-agreement boosts that nudge calibration downward relative to the best. Gen 97’s overconfident floors and high in-tolerance trust cause poor calibration (0.721).

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective
  - Consensus mechanics: Dual tolerances (2% high-rate; 5% low-rate), absolute guards (0.5/0.3 Mbps), activity-based weights (w_a, w_b), and low-rate acceleration (exp 1.2; full convergence at 1.6×tol low-rate vs 2.0×tol high-rate) close asymmetries without over-correcting tiny flows. This combination explains the best’s counter 0.946 advantage over peers at ≈0.939–0.940 (Gen 93/95/96/98/99).
  - Confidence construction: Direction-coupled, share-aware router penalties (local ≈0.6+0.2×share; remote ≈0.4−0.2×share) + post-repair symmetry fit + change magnitude, stabilized with magnitude-aware floors (0.99/0.98/0.97) and quiet-side damping (0.88), yields 0.958 calibration—substantially above the 0.904–0.906 cluster and echoed by Gen 94’s 0.954.
  - Router micro-adjust strategy: Unpaired high-rate dominance checks (≥50%), residual gating (≥3%), small α ≤2%, commit on ≥8% residual improvement and ≤3% internal skew degradation, with confidence reduction on adjusted direction. This careful commit/revert logic improves R1 without harming symmetry, aligning with feedback for Gen 92 and contrasting with Gen 98’s infrequent triggers.
  - Confidence floors harmonization: Geometric-mean stabilization under ultra-agreement on pairs ensures both sides attain high, aligned confidence when diffs ≤0.5% at high rate; this subtle coding detail appears in the best and contributes to top calibration.
- Concrete coding patterns seen across strong performers
  - Constants recur: LOW_RATE_CUTOFF = 10 Mbps; ABS_GUARD = 0.5 Mbps (0.3 low-rate); QUIET_EPS ≈0.1 Mbps; tolerance bands 2%/5%. Many 0.94-scoring programs (Gen 93, 95, 96, 98, 99) implement magnitude-aware thresholds with one-sided trust and prescaling; they differ mainly in threshold and confidence tuning, explaining calibration gaps versus the best.
  - Swap-aware fixes and one-sided trust stabilize highly asymmetric flows (Gen 93, 95, 96, 99), preventing overshoot while allowing assertive corrections when violations are clear.

## Performance Analysis
- Current best sets a higher calibration ceiling with slightly stronger counter repair
  - Best: combined 0.95; counter 0.946; confidence 0.958; status 1.000. The 0.94 cluster (Gen 93/95/96/98/99) reaches counter 0.939–0.940 and confidence 0.904–0.906, indicating the best’s tuning (dual tolerances, floors, share-aware penalties) adds ≈+0.006–0.007 counter and ≈+0.052–0.054 calibration.
- Calibration/counter trade-offs are evident
  - Gen 94 achieves near-best calibration (0.954) but lower counter (0.926), consistent with feedback citing conservative gating and unpaired-link penalties. This contrasts with the best, which balances assertive consensus and guarded micro-adjust to keep counters high without sacrificing calibration.
- Methodological split: targeted consensus pipelines vs global projections
  - Consensus pipelines consistently score high (0.93–0.95 combined), leveraging pairwise symmetry and benefit-checked router nudges. Global/iterative approaches underperform: Gen 91 AWP at 0.80 (counter 0.782) and Gen 97 WLS at 0.78 (counter 0.782; confidence 0.721), confirming prior findings that global projections dampen corrections and miscalibrate.
- Status repair is essentially solved by strict harmonization
  - Almost all top programs report status_repair_accuracy = 1.000 (Gen 92–99), highlighting the effectiveness of down-propagation and pair-consistent rules. Gen 90’s 0.967 status is an outlier and underscores the importance of strict “down ⇒ zero” enforcement seen in the best program and the 0.94 cluster.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Residual-tilted, asymmetric partial averaging within the existing guards
   - In the partial band (tol < diff ≤ full_mult·tol), compute signed router residual resid_signed[r] = (sum_tx − sum_rx)/max(1,sum_tx,sum_rx) and tilt both trust and movement toward reducing the local residual. Use γ = min(0.08, 0.1·abs(resid_signed[router_local])) and, when sign(local − peer) matches sign(resid_signed), set w_local’ = clamp(w_local − γ, 0.2, 0.8), w_peer’ = 1 − w_local’; also split movement with k_loud = k_base·(1 + 0.5·r) and k_quiet = k_base·(1 − 0.5·r), r = (loud − quiet)/max(1,loud). Keep current dual tolerances, absolute guards (0.5/0.3 Mbps), and low-rate exp to preserve calibration while shaving pair residuals and improving R1.

2. Gentle, residual-aware pair prescaling only in the partial band
   - Before computing consensus and k in a direction, apply a bounded pre-scale to soften ratio bias: s = clamp(sqrt(max(1e-9, peer)/max(1e-9, local)), 0.92, 1.08), but only when diff > tol, abs_delta > abs_guard, and both sides ≥ 1 Mbps. If sign(local − peer) matches sign(resid_signed[router_local]), bias s one notch further toward reducing the local residual (e.g., widen clamp to 0.90–1.10 for that case). Use the prescaled values only to compute consensus/k, do not commit them; this mirrors high scorers’ swap-aware/prescale patterns without harming the best program’s guards.

3. Calibration upgrades: severity-adaptive router penalties + ultra-agreement harmonization
   - Modulate share-aware penalty amplitude by residual severity: amp = 0.1 if max(resid_local,resid_remote) < 0.03, 0.2 if < 0.12, else 0.3; then penalty_dir = clamp(1 − ((0.6 + amp·share_dir)·resid_local + (0.4 − amp·share_dir)·resid_remote), 0.5, 1.0). Add an ultra-agreement floor of 0.995 when both directions on the pair have diff ≤ 0.003 and both routers have residual ≤ 0.02, and harmonize final per-direction confidences by raising both to max(current, geometric_mean) under this gate. Relax quiet-side damping to 0.92 when max(local,peer) < LOW_RATE_CUTOFF and peer ≤ 2 Mbps (retain 0.88 otherwise) to keep the best program’s 0.958 calibration while smoothing tiny-flow edges.

4. More effective, still-guarded micro-adjustments: bidirectional simulation + two-interface fallback
   - For the selected dominating unpaired, high-rate interface, simulate both nudge directions (reduce loud vs increase quiet with α = min(0.02, 0.5·resid_frac)) and pick the one that yields the larger router residual improvement, retaining the ≥8% improvement and ≤3% internal-skew degradation guards; on commit, also multiply the peer direction’s confidence by 0.95 to reflect coupling. If no interface meets the ≥50% dominance but two candidates jointly cover ≥75% of the residual and resid_frac ≥ 0.04, allow a split fallback with α_each ≤ 0.01 under the same commit/revert logic. This keeps the best’s tight scope while increasing the chance of R1 improvements in harder topologies.

5. Rate-continuous low-rate acceleration to reduce band-edge artifacts
   - Subdivide the low-rate band to smooth behavior: for max_rate < 2 Mbps use tol=0.06, abs_guard=0.2, exp=1.3, full_mult=1.5; for [2,5) use tol=0.055, abs_guard=0.25, exp=1.25, full_mult=1.55; for [5,10) use tol=0.052, abs_guard=0.3, exp=1.15, full_mult=1.65; keep existing 2%/0.5 Mbps and full_mult=2.0 for ≥10 Mbps. Apply these only when diff > tol and |delta| > abs_guard to maintain the best program’s magnitude-aware guards. This preserves calibration while allowing slightly more assertive convergence
