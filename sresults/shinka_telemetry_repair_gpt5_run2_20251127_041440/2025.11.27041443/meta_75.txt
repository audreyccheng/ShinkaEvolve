# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Network telemetry repair using link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass algorithm computes per-link TX↔RX deviations and repairs rates when violations exceed a 2% threshold by substituting the peer’s corresponding counter, adjusting confidence as 1−relative_diff; it enforces status consistency by lowering confidence on mismatches and zeroing counters for down interfaces reporting traffic. Returns per-field (original, repaired, confidence) and preserves metadata; flow conservation/topology lists are acknowledged but not applied.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs indicate the status consistency heuristic is effective, and confidence is reasonably calibrated; counter repairs are strong but could improve by incorporating flow conservation and fuller topology constraints beyond peer symmetry. The fixed 2% tolerance works, but adaptive thresholds and better handling of missing/unknown peers could enhance robustness and calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score ≈0.80 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.802, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.736.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repairs indicate the symmetry + flow-conservation strategy is effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, likely due to residual-based penalty scaling and assumptions for dangling links; tuning penalty weighting or handling incomplete topology could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name flow_informed_pairwise_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds unique interface pairs via connected_to, harmonizes status (traffic implies up), and enforces link symmetry using a 2% hardening threshold by averaging mismatched TX/RX pairs; down links are zeroed.

**Program Name: POCS-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iterative POCS alternates link-symmetry and router flow-conservation projections with damping (LINK_DAMP=0.6, ROUTER_DAMP=0.5) over 10 iterations, enforcing non-negativity and zeroing down interfaces. Status is harmonized via link-pair consistency and traffic evidence, and confidences blend change magnitude (0.55), router residuals (0.25), and link residuals (0.20) with a 2% hardening threshold.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.673; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.627).
- **Feedback**: Pairwise status reconciliation plus zero-traffic checks yielded perfect status accuracy, while damped projections provided stable but only moderate counter improvements. Confidence calibration was reasonable but could improve with smoother residual penalties or adaptive weights.

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise hardening using link symmetry (2% tolerance), averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, and harmonizes status via traffic evidence; then applies router-level flow conservation using a per-router shift (v' = v − s_tx + s_rx) and clamps non-negativity. Confidence scores start from 1−diff, are penalized by magnitude of applied changes, and further scaled by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces retain values with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68; counter_repair_accuracy 0.636, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.777.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate the link-symmetry thresholding and confidence penalties are well-tuned, while moderate counter repair suggests the averaging and balancing step could be refined to better correct rate mismatches. Effectiveness depends on accurate connected_to and router metadata, as these drive both pairwise reconciliation and router balancing.

Confidence is clamped and derived from relative mismatch; topology is merged with telemetry to complete router-interface maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status repair and strong counter corrections; confidence is reasonably calibrated but not perfect. The first-pass symmetry violation map is unused, and flow-conservation is only used to attenuate confidence, suggesting potential gains by using these signals to adjust values when safe.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85: counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.885; all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair indicates effective status harmonization; strong confidence calibration reflects well-tuned penalties and floors. Slightly conservative counter adjustments (guards and partial averaging) likely trade a bit of repair accuracy for stability, especially on low-rate links.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 67 - Patch Name residual_tilt_and_share_weighted_confidence - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Alternating Projections Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iteratively projects counters onto link-direction symmetry and per-router flow conservation with forced-down propagation. Uses activity-weighted consensus updates, rate-aware tolerances/guards, iterative step scaling, and computes confidences from router residuals, link fit, and change magnitude with magnitude-aware floors and silent-side shaping.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.768, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.738); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Forced-down consistency likely drove perfect status repair, while weighted link reconciliation and gentle-to-firm router balancing yielded strong counter fixes. Confidence calibration is solid but could be improved by tuning floors/penalties and thresholds for low-rate handling and quiet-side damping.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 68 - Patch Name global_alternating_projections - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Direction- and Magnitude-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise, direction-aware consensus using residual-tilted weighted averaging with magnitude-aware thresholds (2%/5% relative, 0.5/0.3 Mbps absolute) and asymmetric partial averaging; router-level micro-adjustments act only on dominant dangling interfaces with benefit checks, skew guard, and optional second mini-step. Confidence combines change penalties, high-rate floors, and router-residual weighting; down links are zeroed and statuses harmonized.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85; counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.882; all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair shows robust status harmonization and down-link suppression, while strong confidence calibration reflects well-tuned change/residual penalties. Slightly submax counter repair suggests conservative absolute guards and tight micro-adjustment gating may leave some mismatches uncorrected.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name residual_tilt_and_share_aware_confidence - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Consensus-and-Residual Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses trust-weighted, directional consensus to align peer counters with partial averaging near thresholds and magnitude-aware guards (ABS_GUARD, QUIET_EPS), plus confidence floors and asymmetric scaling.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.946, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.958.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status correction and strong confidence calibration; minor counter discrepancies likely stem from conservative handling at low rates or guard-blocked mismatches to avoid overcorrection. Benefit-checked router adjustments reduce residuals without degrading link-level symmetry.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name safer_micro_and_share_aware_penalties - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Residual-tilted link consensus with router micro-adjustments**
- **Implementation**: Per-link, direction-aware partial averaging uses magnitude-aware thresholds, absolute guards, and residual-tilted targets, with asymmetric moves favoring the louder side and steeper low-rate ramps. Router-level benefit-checked micro-adjustments on dominant dangling interfaces reduce flow imbalance, and confidences are penalized by applied change and share-aware local/remote residuals; link status is harmonized and enforced.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85: counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.885.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects robust interface consistency and down-link enforcement, while strong confidence calibration benefits from residual-coupled, share-aware penalties.

**Program Name: Tilted Asymmetric Consensus Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Implements residual-tilted, activity-weighted directional consensus with asymmetric partial averaging, preceded by multiplicative pair-bias harmonization. Router-level micro-adjustments correct dominant unpaired interfaces, and tri-axis confidence blends share-aware router penalties, symmetry fit, and correction magnitude; down-status consistency zeroes both sides.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95: counter_repair_accuracy 0.940, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.957.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status accuracy and calibrated confidences suggest effective gating and symmetry-aware scoring, with absolute/magnitude guards preventing overcorrection. Remaining counter discrepancies likely reflect conservative thresholds and disabled paired reconciliation; selectively enabling Stage 2 under strong evidence could yield incremental gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name tilt_asym_fix_disable_pair_reconcile - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Consensus-Residual Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Implements trust-weighted directional consensus with residual-tilted weights, magnitude-aware gating (relative/absolute guards), and asymmetric confidence shaping, plus geometric-mean confidence floors. Adds router-level micro-adjustments for dominating unpaired interfaces and composes final confidences via router-penalties, symmetry fit, and change magnitude; propagates down status consistently.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.94 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.934, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.938); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy and strong confidence calibration suggest the gating and consensus rules prevent over-correction while maintaining agreement. Router-level micro-adjustments contribute to flow conservation improvements without destabilizing interface-level balance, supporting precise counter repairs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name residual_tilt_lowrate_asym_partial - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Pair-Bias Consensus Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Detects multiplicative pair-bias and prescales the quieter endpoint, then applies trust-weighted, direction-aware consensus with magnitude-aware tolerances, absolute guards, partial averaging, and asymmetric confidence shaping. Adds router-level flow-conservation micro-adjustments with benefit checks and composes final confidences from share-aware router residual penalties, post-repair symmetry fit, and correction magnitude.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.95 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.945, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.953); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Strong status repair and confidence calibration indicate the hardening rules and tri-axis confidence model are effective, while high counter accuracy reflects successful consensus and pair-bias handling. Conservative guards and scoped router nudges likely prevented over-corrections, with minor headroom remaining to tighten counter discrepancies without hurting calibration.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Direction-aware, trust-weighted consensus with magnitude-aware gating and partial-to-full averaging
  - Current best implementation (matches Gen 66 “Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence Calibration” and Gen 70 “Consensus-and-Residual Telemetry Repair”) uses activity weights (w_a, w_b), dual tolerances (2% for high-rate, 5% for low-rate), absolute guards (0.5 Mbps, relaxed to 0.3 on low-rate bands), and low-rate-accelerated partial averaging with full convergence under clear violations. These achieved combined ≈0.95 with counter 0.946 and confidence ≈0.958.
  - Similar variants scored slightly lower when the consensus was more conservative: Gen 65 (0.95; counter 0.939), Gen 63 (0.94; counter 0.938).
- Tri-axis confidence with share-aware router penalties, symmetry fit, and change magnitude, plus magnitude-aware floors and quiet-side shaping
  - The best programs consistently blend 0.45×router penalties (direction-coupled, share-weighted), 0.35×post-repair symmetry fit, and 0.20×correction magnitude, with strong floors (0.99 for ≤0.5% diff on high-rate; 0.98/0.97 otherwise) and 0.88 quiet-side damping. This yielded top calibration: Gen 66 (0.958), Gen 70 (0.958), Gen 74 (0.953).
  - The current best further stabilizes floors with geometric-mean harmonization under very strong agreement.
- Tightly scoped router micro-adjustments on dominant unpaired interfaces, with improvement/guard checks
  - Best performers restrict R1 nudges to a single dominating dangling interface per router, cap α ≤ 2%, gate on residual ≥3%, and commit only if router residual improves by ≥8% without worsening internal skew by >3% (as in current best and Gen 66). This preserves link-level symmetry gains while improving flow balance, sustaining counter ≈0.946 and calibration ≈0.958.
- Strict status harmonization with down-propagation and zeroing
  - Ubiquitously delivers status_repair_accuracy = 1.000 across all strong submissions (e.g., Gen 63–74 and the current best).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Over-conservative consensus/guards and partial-move logic
  - The 0.85 cluster consistently capped counter_repair_accuracy at 0.834 despite perfect status and decent calibration (~0.882–0.888): Gen 60, 61, 62, 64, 67, 69, 71. Feedback points to cautious thresholds/absolute guards and partial averaging that under-correct mismatches, especially on low-rate links and when micro-steps are tightly gated.
- Iterative global projections/balancing
  - Gen 68 “Alternating Projections Telemetry Repair” dropped to combined 0.77 (counter 0.768; confidence 0.738). Iterative projections onto link symmetry and router conservation degraded calibration and underperformed targeted, benefit-checked micro-adjustments.
- Unconstrained/global router balancing (from prior evaluations)
  - Earlier “POCS Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing” (Gen 41 in previous insights) fell to combined 0.62 (counter 0.620; confidence 0.510), indicating global balancing distorts otherwise-correct per-link repairs.
- Fragile pipeline/integration
  - “Pairwise Link Hardening with Router-Calibrated Confidence” (Gen 55 in previous insights) collapsed to combined 0.02, suggesting miswiring of repair/assembly/confidence stages can sink all metrics even with standard components.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective
  - Consensus details: activity-weighted blending; dual tolerances (2%/5%) paired with absolute guards (0.5 Mbps, reduced to 0.3 at low rate); low-rate acceleration (exponent ~1.2, full-convergence threshold 1.6×tol vs 2.0×tol at high rate). These choices close gaps without overcorrecting tiny flows, lifting counters from 0.834 (0.85-cluster) to 0.946 (Gen 66/70).
  - Confidence construction: direction-coupled, share-aware router penalties (local weight ≈0.6 adjusted by traffic share; remote ≈0.4 inversely), combined with post-repair symmetry fit and change magnitude; floors at 0.99/0.98/0.97 and 0.88 quiet-side damping. Sequencing after all repairs (including micro-adjustments) aligns penalties with final counters, reaching calibration ~0.958 (Gen 66, 70).
  - Micro-adjust targeting and commit: pick only unpaired, up, high-rate interfaces; dominance ≥50% of imbalance; α ≤2% scaled by residual fraction; commit only with ≥8% residual improvement and ≤3% added internal skew; reduce confidence of adjusted direction. This keeps router balance improvements from harming link symmetry or calibration.
  - Confidence floors harmonization: when both directions show very strong agreement, geometric-mean floors stabilize high confidences on both sides, supporting top-tier calibration (seen in the current best).
- Additional coding patterns observed in top performers
  - Constants LOW_RATE_CUTOFF = 10 Mbps, ABS_GUARD = 0.5 Mbps, QUIET_EPS ≈ 0.1 Mbps recur across high scorers (Gen 66, 70, 74).
  - Multiplicative pair-bias prescaling appears in some strong variants (Gen 65, 72, 74) and yields solid results (combined 0.95; counter 0.939–0.945) but is not required to reach the top counters/calibration seen in Gen 66/70.

## Performance Analysis
- Top-tier performance is clustered around combined 0.95 with counter 0.940–0.946 and calibration 0.953–0.958
  - Best counters/calibration: Gen 66 and Gen 70 at counter 0.946, confidence 0.958. Close contenders: Gen 74 (counter 0.945; confidence 0.953), Gen 72 (0.940; 0.957), Gen 65 (0.939; 0.956).
- Clear separation from the 0.85 cluster
  - Programs with similar high-level ideas but conservative thresholds/guards and cautious micro-steps plateau at counter 0.834, confidence ~0.882–0.888 (e.g., Gen 60–62, 64, 67, 69, 71). The delta to the best counters is ~+0.112 and to calibration ~+0.070.
- Iterative/global methods underperform targeted, gated pipelines
  - Gen 68’s global alternating projections achieved only combined 0.77 (counter 0.768; confidence 0.738), compared to 0.95 with targeted consensus + micro-adjustments, underscoring the benefit of localized, evidence-based corrections.
- Pair-bias prescaling provides incremental gains but is not the primary driver
  - Variants with multiplicative harmonization (Gen 65, 72, 74) achieve combined 0.95 but typically slightly lower counters than the best (0.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Residual-tilted, direction-aware consensus weights in pair repair
   - Before the pair loop, compute each router’s signed residual on the original telemetry: resid_signed[r] = (sum_tx − sum_rx)/max(1,sum_tx,sum_rx). In direction a->b, if sign(a_tx − b_rx) matches sign(resid_signed[router_a]), slightly tilt activity weights to reduce the local residual: w_a’ = clamp(w_a − γ, 0.2, 0.8), w_b’ = 1 − w_a’, with γ = min(0.08, 0.1·abs(resid_signed[router_a])). Apply w’ only when both triggers fire (diff > tol and |a_tx − b_rx| > abs_guard), preserving current guards and low-rate treatment.

2. Asymmetric partial averaging that moves the louder side more
   - In the partial band (tol < diff ≤ full_mult·tol), replace the single k with k_loud/k_quiet so the louder endpoint moves more toward consensus. Let k_base = ((diff − tol)/tol)^exp, loud = argmax(side values), quiet = the other, r = (loud − quiet)/max(1.0, loud); then k_loud = clamp(k_base·(1 + 0.5·r), 0, 1) and k_quiet = clamp(k_base·(1 − 0.5·r), 0, 1). Update each side with its own k, retaining current low-rate acceleration (exp=1.2, full trigger 1.6×tol) and absolute guards.

3. Gentle multiplicative pair-bias prescaling before averaging
   - Before computing the consensus for each direction, multiplicatively pre-harmonize the pair to reduce ratio bias: s = clamp(sqrt(max(1e-9, peer_side)/max(1e-9, local_side))), 0.90, 1.10). Use local’ = local_side·s and peer’ = peer_side/s only for computing consensus and k (do not commit these prescaled values directly). Gate this prescale to links with diff > tol and |delta| > abs_guard, and skip on extremely low-rate pairs (<1 Mbps) to avoid amplifying noise; this mirrors Gen 65/72/74’s solid gains without changing the proven guards.

4. Calibration refinement: residual-severity–adaptive router penalties and conservative quiet-side damping at low rate
   - Modulate the share amplitude in the router penalty by residual severity: amp = 0.1 if max(resid_local,resid_remote) < 0.03, 0.2 if < 0.12, else 0.3; use penalty_tx = 1 − ((0.6 + amp·tx_share)·resid_local + (0.4 − amp·tx_share)·resid_remote) (clamped). Additionally, for quiet-side shaping, keep the 0.88 factor on high-rate links, but relax to 0.92 when max(local,peer) < LOW_RATE_CUTOFF and peer traffic ≤ 2 Mbps to avoid over-penalizing tiny flows. Retain current floors and geometric-mean harmonization; optionally raise the ultra-agreement floor to 0.995 when both directions have diff ≤ 0.003 and both routers show residual ≤ 0.02.

5. Smarter micro-adjustments: evaluate both directions and allow a guarded second mini-step
   - For the chosen dominating unpaired interface, simulate both nudge options (adjust tx vs adjust rx by α) and pick the one yielding the larger router residual improvement while satisfying the current internal-skew guard; keep α = min(0.02, 0.5·resid_frac). If the first commit improves the router residual by ≥20% and resid_frac remains ≥0.04, allow a second mini-step with α2 ≤ 0.01 under the same guards. On commit, lower the adjusted direction’s confidence as now (0.6–0.8 band), and additionally cap the other direction’s confidence at max(current, 0.95·that value) to mildly reflect coupling without harming calibration.
