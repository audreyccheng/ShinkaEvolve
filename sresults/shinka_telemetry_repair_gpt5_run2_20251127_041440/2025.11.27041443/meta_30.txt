# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Network telemetry repair using link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass algorithm computes per-link TX↔RX deviations and repairs rates when violations exceed a 2% threshold by substituting the peer’s corresponding counter, adjusting confidence as 1−relative_diff; it enforces status consistency by lowering confidence on mismatches and zeroing counters for down interfaces reporting traffic. Returns per-field (original, repaired, confidence) and preserves metadata; flow conservation/topology lists are acknowledged but not applied.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs indicate the status consistency heuristic is effective, and confidence is reasonably calibrated; counter repairs are strong but could improve by incorporating flow conservation and fuller topology constraints beyond peer symmetry. The fixed 2% tolerance works, but adaptive thresholds and better handling of missing/unknown peers could enhance robustness and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Pairwise Topology-Guided Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Enforces link symmetry via pairwise hardening with a 2% tolerance and selects repairs that reduce per-router flow-imbalance (sum(tx)−sum(rx)); interface statuses are preserved (not modified), counters are zeroed when status is down, and confidence blends discrepancy magnitude with imbalance improvement. Falls back to single-interface sanity checks with moderate confidence when peers are missing.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.80; counter_repair_accuracy 0.790; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.776.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy indicates preserving status and calibrating confidence was effective; strong but not perfect counter accuracy and confidence suggest room to fine-tune tolerance or incorporate broader topology constraints. The solution is correct and passed all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name pairwise_hardening_flow_choice - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Builds canonical link pairs from connected_to, harmonizes pair status using traffic evidence, and enforces link symmetry with a 2% hardening threshold while zeroing traffic on down links. Computes router-level flow residuals to scale per-field confidences and handles dangling interfaces by preserving values with conservative confidences.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85; counter_repair_accuracy 0.834; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.888.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy indicates robust status harmonization, while slightly lower counter accuracy suggests residual asymmetries or conservative averaging near the threshold. Confidence calibration benefits from router residual scaling; further tuning of penalties/thresholds may yield incremental gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name pairwise_and_flow_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair with flow conservation**
- **Implementation**: Builds link pairs, harmonizes status via traffic evidence, and enforces bidirectional link symmetry by selecting among A.tx/B.rx/average based on minimal router-level imbalance; down links are zeroed. Computes router flow residuals and scales confidences using local+remote penalties, with conservative defaults for dangling interfaces and tie-breaking to avoid unnecessary averaging.
- **Performance**: Achieved counter_repair_accuracy 0.803, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.730; combined score ≈ 0.80.
- **Feedback**: Router-informed candidate selection improved counter repair while the status decision logic yielded perfect status accuracy. Confidence calibration trails due to high base confidences near tolerance and coarse residual penalties; tuning the 2% threshold and confidence scaling could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name router_informed_link_choice - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Performs per-link hardening that enforces TX/RX symmetry with a 2% tolerance and selects repaired values via a flow-conservation cost across both routers; status is harmonized using traffic evidence, down links are zeroed, and dangling interfaces are retained with lower confidence. A second pass computes router-level residuals to scale per-field confidence, while preserving metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined score ≈0.80 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.802, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.736.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repairs indicate the symmetry + flow-conservation strategy is effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, likely due to residual-based penalty scaling and assumptions for dangling links; tuning penalty weighting or handling incomplete topology could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name flow_informed_pairwise_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds unique interface pairs via connected_to, harmonizes status (traffic implies up), and enforces link symmetry using a 2% hardening threshold by averaging mismatched TX/RX pairs; down links are zeroed. Computes router-level flow residuals from repaired rates and scales per-field confidences (milder for status), with sensible defaults for dangling interfaces and calibrated confidence shaping.
- **Performance**: Combined: 0.85; counter_repair_accuracy: 0.834; status_repair_accuracy: 1.000; confidence_calibration: 0.888.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair shows the pairwise harmonization and traffic-based decisions are effective. Strong but sub-perfect counter repair and high calibration suggest symmetry averaging plus router-residual penalties boost accuracy and confidence reliability.

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs per-link counters via symmetry by comparing a_tx with b_rx and b_tx with a_rx using a 2% tolerance, fusing values by selecting the side with lower paired-direction error; enforces down-state propagation with zeroed rates. Builds router-to-interface mapping, computes router-level tx/rx mismatch to attenuate confidences (up to 50%), and sets default confidences for unpaired links.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.81; counter_repair_accuracy 0.828; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.690.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects effective down-state enforcement and consistent link-level fusion; counter repair is strong, likely due to direction-specific trust selection. Confidence calibration trails, suggesting tuning router-mismatch attenuation or base confidence levels to better match uncertainty.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name link_fusion_and_confidence_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair with symmetry and flow**
- **Implementation**: Builds undirected interface pairs and harmonizes status using traffic evidence, enforcing link symmetry with a 2% tolerance by averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx. Confidence is derived from 1−normalized-diff, boosted when within tolerance, then penalized by change magnitude; router-level flow conservation is computed and applied as a confidence penalty (not a value repair), with special handling for down or unpaired interfaces.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 0.85 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.888.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy suggests the pairwise status harmonization and zeroing down links are effective. Counter repairs are strong but could improve by leveraging flow conservation for direct adjustments or using adaptive thresholds; confidence is well-calibrated due to change-based penalties and router residual scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name change_based_confidence_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Pairwise Link Hardening with Router-Aware Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Builds undirected link pairs from connected_to and enforces symmetry with a 2% threshold by averaging A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, deriving confidences from normalized differences with a high-confidence floor when within tolerance. Determines status via interface agreement plus traffic evidence, zeroes rates on down links, handles dangling interfaces with moderate confidence, and scales confidences using local and remote router flow-residual penalties (weight 0.5) with mild status scaling.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.888).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects robust traffic-backed status harmonization and enforced zeroing on down pairs. Confidence calibration benefits from router residual penalties; counter accuracy trails because router conservation influences only confidences (not values) and pairwise averaging can miss asymmetric or multi-interface imbalances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name hodor_pairwise_router_penalty_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: POCS-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Iterative POCS alternates link-symmetry and router flow-conservation projections with damping (LINK_DAMP=0.6, ROUTER_DAMP=0.5) over 10 iterations, enforcing non-negativity and zeroing down interfaces. Status is harmonized via link-pair consistency and traffic evidence, and confidences blend change magnitude (0.55), router residuals (0.25), and link residuals (0.20) with a 2% hardening threshold.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.673; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.627).
- **Feedback**: Pairwise status reconciliation plus zero-traffic checks yielded perfect status accuracy, while damped projections provided stable but only moderate counter improvements. Confidence calibration was reasonable but could improve with smoother residual penalties or adaptive weights.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name pocs_flow_projector - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise hardening using link symmetry (2% tolerance), averaging mismatched A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx, and harmonizes status via traffic evidence; then applies router-level flow conservation using a per-router shift (v' = v − s_tx + s_rx) and clamps non-negativity. Confidence scores start from 1−diff, are penalized by magnitude of applied changes, and further scaled by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces retain values with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.68; counter_repair_accuracy 0.636, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.777.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate the link-symmetry thresholding and confidence penalties are well-tuned, while moderate counter repair suggests the averaging and balancing step could be refined to better correct rate mismatches. Effectiveness depends on accurate connected_to and router metadata, as these drive both pairwise reconciliation and router balancing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name router_balancing_step_and_conf_calibration - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Pairwise link-symmetry hardening with a 2% threshold averages mismatched TX/RX in both directions and harmonizes status using traffic evidence. Router-level flow conservation adjusts only dangling interfaces proportionally, while confidences are computed per-field and scaled by local/remote router residuals; down links are zeroed with high confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.85 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.888; num_scenarios 0).
- **Feedback**: The approach delivers perfect status repairs and strong confidence calibration, with small counter errors likely from the conservative threshold and proportional balancing strategy. Residual-based confidence penalties add robustness; default lower confidence on unpaired interfaces is reasonable but may limit precision when topology is incomplete.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name router_balancing_dangling - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair Solver**
- **Implementation**: Performs pairwise link hardening using 2% symmetry tolerance, then solves a coupled least-squares system with dynamic regularization informed by router imbalances to repair tx/rx while enforcing status consistency and non-negativity.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.73 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.719; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.720); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Traffic-evidence-based status inference and symmetry-aware repairs drove perfect status accuracy, and router-residual penalties yielded well-calibrated confidences. Slightly lower counter repair indicates potential gains from tuning the regularization strength or the proportional balancing on dangling interfaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name router_coupled_symmetry_solver - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair via link symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Uses link symmetry and flow conservation: builds unique interface pairs, resolves status mismatches via traffic evidence, and when symmetry differs by >2% selects a repaired value (average or keep-side) that minimizes adjacent routers’ flow-residual, updating running TX/RX sums. A second pass computes per-router residuals and scales confidences (boosted on residual improvement, penalized by local/remote residuals); down links are zeroed, unpaired interfaces are retained with lower confidence, and outputs are (original, repaired, confidence) plus metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.78 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.777, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.749).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy stems from consistent pairwise status harmonization backed by traffic evidence.

**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name pairwise_plus_router_balance - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Informed Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Enforces link symmetry and flow conservation: pairwise hardening selects between endpoint and average rates using a router-imbalance cost, harmonizes status via traffic evidence, and performs router micro-balance with weighted adjustments propagated to peers to preserve symmetry. Confidence blends mismatch reduction and improvement, then is penalized by local/remote router residuals; dangling interfaces are retained with reduced confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.62 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.589, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.657.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair indicates robust status harmonization, while moderate counter repair suggests residual flow imbalances or conservative tie-breaking limit rate corrections. Confidence calibration is solid, aligning with residual-based penalties and change-magnitude scaling.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.80 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.803, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.738); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Router-informed cost selection and tolerance rules produced perfect status repairs and strong counter fixes. Confidence calibration is modest—confidence floors and residual penalties appear a bit over-assertive; tuning these weights or adding post-hoc calibration could improve calibration scores.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name magnitude_aware_tolerance_and_directional_penalty - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Magnitude-aware Bi-directional Consensus Repair**
- **Implementation**: Builds undirected interface pairs and enforces link symmetry via consensus averaging when relative and absolute mismatches exceed magnitude-aware thresholds (2%/5% with 0.5 Mbps guard), with strong agreement floors on confidences. Harmonizes pair status, zeros traffic on down links, handles dangling interfaces conservatively, and applies direction-aware confidence penalties using router-level flow-residuals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.888).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs stem from strict pairwise harmonization and down-link zeroing, while confidence calibration benefits from agreement floors and residual-driven penalties. Counter accuracy is strong but leaves room for further refinement in disagreement handling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name robust_bi_directional_consensus - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs counters via link symmetry using magnitude-aware dynamic thresholds and an absolute-difference guard, with forced-down status propagation across connected interfaces.

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs per-link RX/TX using symmetry with magnitude-aware tolerances (5% under 10 Mbps, else 2%) and a 0.5 Mbps absolute guard, enforces pairwise status consistency (any-down => both down, zero rates), and applies router-level flow conservation as direction-aware confidence penalties (0.6 local/0.4 remote) without altering values. Confidence is clamped and derived from relative mismatch; topology is merged with telemetry to complete router-interface maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status repair and strong counter corrections; confidence is reasonably calibrated but not perfect.

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses magnitude-aware link symmetry to harmonize peer counters (dynamic tolerance, absolute guard, and averaging when divergences exceed thresholds), status harmonization via traffic evidence, and per-interface fallbacks for dangling peers.

**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name magnitude_aware_and_directional_conf - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Symmetry and Conservation**
- **Implementation**: Repairs per-link counters by mirroring peer values when relative mismatches exceed 2% (or 5% under 10 Mbps) and >0.5 Mbps absolute delta, and propagates "down" status to zero both sides with calibrated confidence.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83; counter_repair_accuracy 0.827, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.820.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status consistency and well-calibrated confidence penalties; counter repairs are strong but conservative, likely due to the absolute guard and not using conservation to adjust values.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83; counter_repair_accuracy 0.827, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.798.
- **Feedback**: Excellent status accuracy is driven by consistent down-state propagation and pair consistency checks. High counter accuracy benefits from symmetry-based corrections and residual nudging; confidence is well-calibrated overall but slightly overconfident near thresholds due to confidence floors.

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs telemetry by pairing interfaces via connected_to, harmonizing status using traffic evidence, and enforcing link symmetry with dynamic rate-aware thresholds and absolute guards; then scales per-counter confidences by router-level flow-conservation residuals with direction-aware weights, penalizing large changes and handling dangling/down interfaces conservatively. Outputs (original, repaired, confidence) tuples while preserving topology metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.85 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.887; all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Dynamic τ thresholds and magnitude-aware guards prevented overcorrection and yielded strong confidence calibration, while flow-residual penalties improved robustness across routers. Perfect status accuracy indicates effective status harmonization; the remaining counter accuracy gap suggests potential tuning around low-rate links or averaging strategy.

**Program Name: Hodor-style router-aware telemetry repair**
- **Implementation**: Enforces pairwise link symmetry (A.tx≈B.rx, B.tx≈A.rx) with magnitude-aware tolerances (2% base, 5% under 10 Mbps), an absolute-diff guard (0.5 Mbps), confidence floors, and status harmonization via status+traffic evidence; router-level flow residuals penalize confidences (weight 0.5; status blend 0.25). Dangling interfaces get conservative pass-through with moderate confidence, while down links are zeroed.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.85 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.834, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.888); all validation tests passed.

**Program Name: Topology-aware Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair uses link symmetry and interface consistency with dynamic magnitude-aware thresholds (2% or 5%) plus a 0.5 Mbps absolute guard to avoid over-correcting small flows. Router-level flow-conservation residuals apply direction-aware penalties to confidence, and confidences are calibrated based on agreement strength; if either side is down, the pair is forced down with zero rates.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.827; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.817; num_scenarios 0).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repairs and strong confidence calibration; counter repair is robust but not flawless. Direction-aware router penalties and the absolute guard likely reduced false positives; modest threshold tuning may further improve counter accuracy and calibration.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Pairwise link-symmetry averaging with a 2% tolerance consistently yields top scores
  - The current best program (Combined 0.85; counter 0.834; confidence 0.888) uses a fixed HARDENING_THRESHOLD=0.02 and averages A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx only when normalized diff exceeds 2%. Similar 0.85 performers follow the same symmetry-averaging principle, sometimes with magnitude-aware variants: Gen 24 “symmetry_flow_harden_v2” (0.85), Gen 26 “magnitude_aware_symmetry_and_directional_confidence” (0.85), Gen 28 “magnitude_aware_symmetry” (0.85).
- Traffic-evidence-based status harmonization with zeroing on down links saturates status_repair_accuracy at 1.000
  - All listed programs achieved 1.000 status accuracy by reconciling mismatched statuses via traffic presence and setting both ends to down with zeroed rates when resolved as down (e.g., current best, Gen 17 “robust_bi_directional_consensus” at 0.85, Gen 20 “diraware_consensus_microflow” at 0.85).
- Router-level flow conservation used to scale confidences (not to change values) produces strong calibration
  - The best calibration cluster (≈0.887–0.888) comes from penalizing per-field confidence by both local and remote router residuals, typically with balanced weighting (penalty = 1 − 0.5 × (resid_local + resid_remote)). Examples: current best (0.888), Gen 20 (0.888), Gen 24 (0.888), Gen 26 (0.887), Gen 27 (0.887), Gen 28 (0.888).
- Conservative handling of dangling interfaces avoids counter accuracy regressions
  - Keeping original values with moderate confidence (current best assigns 0.6) or limiting micro-adjustments only to dangling ports maintains top counter accuracy (Gen 20, Gen 25, Gen 26 all at 0.85 combined with counter 0.834).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Router-wide or propagating flow balancing that adjusts values degrades counter accuracy
  - Gen 15 “router_microbalance_and_symmetry_propagation” performed router micro-balance propagated across peers and dropped to counter 0.589 (combined 0.62). Earlier analogous global strategies also underperformed: Gen 10 (combined 0.68, counter 0.636), Gen 9 POCS (combined 0.68, counter 0.673), and Gen 12 solver-based coupling (combined 0.73, counter 0.719).
- Over-assertive or coarse confidence floors/penalties hurt calibration
  - Gen 16 “magnitude_aware_tolerance_and_directional_penalty” shows confidence_calibration 0.738 despite good counters (0.803); feedback cites over-assertive confidence floors and penalties. Gen 23 “directional_micro_adjust_and_conf_floor_tune” also lags (0.798 calibration), with feedback pointing to floors being overconfident near thresholds.
- Unused computation adds complexity without benefit
  - Several 0.83 programs compute symmetry-violation maps or flow residuals but don’t use them to improve values; while not harming scores (e.g., Gen 22 “magnitude_aware_and_router_confidence” notes an unused violation map), this indicates inefficiency with no observed performance gain.

## Implementation Insights
- Canonical undirected pairing and per-direction normalized-diff gating drive safe averaging
  - The current best builds canonical pairs from connected_to, computes per-direction diffs (A.tx vs B.rx; B.tx vs A.rx), and averages only when diff > 2%. This targeted enforcement reduces overcorrection and correlates with counter_repair_accuracy 0.834 across the 0.85 cluster.
- Two-pass design improves confidence calibration
  - Repair pairs and statuses first, then compute router residuals on repaired rates, and finally scale confidences. This pattern, used by the current best and other 0.85 programs (e.g., Gen 24, 26, 28), yields high confidence_calibration (~0.887–0.888) because residuals reflect post-repair states.
- Confidence shaping that combines agreement strength, high-confidence floors within tolerance, and residual-based penalties is effective
  - The current best derives base confidence from 1 − normalized diff, floors to ~0.98 when within tolerance, then multiplies by a balanced residual penalty (local+remote). Status confidence is only mildly scaled. This matches the top calibration scores (0.888) observed in Gen 20, 24, 28 as well.
- Status resolution anchored in traffic evidence and symmetric zeroing on down links is decisive
  - When up/down disagrees, decide “up” if any traffic is observed; otherwise “down,” and zero both ends. Assign high status confidence when down-without-traffic and moderate otherwise. This coding pattern explains the ubiquitous 1.000 status_repair_accuracy (current best, Gen 17–29).

## Performance Analysis
- Clear top cluster at Combined 0.85 with counter 0.834 and confidence ~0.887–0.888
  - Programs: current best; Gen 17, 20, 21, 24–28. Common traits: robust pairwise symmetry averaging (2% base or magnitude-aware), traffic-based status harmonization, and router residuals used solely for confidence scaling. Threshold guard choices (fixed 2% in current best vs. 2%/5% + 0.5 Mbps guard in others) do not materially change top-level scores.
- Mid-tier cluster at Combined 0.83 primarily differs in confidence calibration and slightly more conservative counter fixes
  - Programs: Gen 18, 19, 22, 23, 29 with counter ≈0.827 and confidence ≈0.795–0.820. These typically apply magnitude-aware tolerances and absolute guards, and use residuals only for confidence, but their confidence shaping (e.g., clamping ranges, floors) is less precise than the top cluster.
- Outlier poor performance when adjusting values with router balancing
  - Gen 15 (combined 0.62; counter 0.589) highlights that router-level micro-balance propagated across peers undermines counter accuracy despite perfect status repair. This aligns with earlier evidence against global balancing (Gen 9/10/12).
- Status accuracy is saturated at 1.000 across all variants
  - The decisive contributors—pairwise status harmonization via traffic evidence and zeroing on down—are stable across implementations (including the current best), shifting optimization focus to counter accuracy and confidence calibration.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add magnitude-aware symmetry gating with an absolute guard and sharper in-tolerance floors
   - Keep the 2% HARDENING_THRESHOLD but raise it to 5% when max(a, b) < 10 Mbps and also require an absolute difference > 0.5 Mbps to trigger averaging. Within tolerance, floor confidence higher only on very strong agreement: if max(a, b) ≥ 10 Mbps and normalized diff ≤ 0.5%, floor at 0.99; otherwise 0.98. This preserves the proven 2% averaging pattern while avoiding over-corrections on tiny flows and sharpening calibration on clear matches.

2. Make router-residual penalties direction-aware for tx and rx confidences
   - Replace the single penalty with per-direction scaling: tx_conf *= clamp(1 − (0.6 × resid_local + 0.4 × resid_remote), 0, 1) and rx_conf *= clamp(1 − (0.6 × resid_remote + 0.4 × resid_local), 0, 1). Keep status_conf mildly scaled (e.g., status_conf *= 0.85 + 0.15 × min(pen_tx, pen_rx)) to maintain the strong calibration observed while aligning confidence with traffic directionality.

3. Use partial averaging just above the threshold to reduce overcorrection while keeping full averaging for clear violations
   - For HARDENING_THRESHOLD < diff ≤ 2 × HARDENING_THRESHOLD (and guards satisfied), set both endpoints to lerp(original, avg, k) where k = (diff − T) / T, T = HARDENING_THRESHOLD; for diff > 2T, fall back to full averaging. Apply this independently per direction (A.tx/B.rx and B.tx/A.rx). This softens corrections near the boundary, which can improve calibration without degrading counter accuracy.

4. Apply tightly scoped micro-adjustments only on dominating dangling interfaces
   - For unpaired, up interfaces, if the router’s absolute imbalance |sum_tx − sum_rx| is high and this interface accounts for >50% of that imbalance, nudge only its larger counter by α = min(0.02, 0.5 × resid_local) toward reducing the imbalance (cap change at 2%). Otherwise, leave dangling values unchanged. Increase its confidence modestly when adjusted (e.g., from 0.6 to 0.6 + 0.2 × α/0.02) to reflect alignment with conservation while preserving the conservative handling that protects counter accuracy.

5. Make confidence assignment asymmetric when “up” is decided purely by traffic evidence
   - If pair_status is “up” due to observed traffic but only one side shows traffic, give the traffic-bearing side a higher confidence (e.g., keep current base/floor) and multiply the silent side’s tx/rx confidences by 0.85–0.9. When both sides are up and both per-direction diffs ≤ 0.5%, raise status_conf to 0.97–0.99 and harmonize link-direction confidences by setting tx_conf(A) and rx_conf(B) to their geometric mean to keep pairwise calibration consistent.
