# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link Symmetry-Based Network Telemetry Repair Algorithm**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm validates telemetry using link symmetry invariants, substituting peer values when discrepancies exceed a 2% threshold and calculating confidence scores based on the magnitude of the deviation.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Probabilistic Hypothesis Selection (Current Best):** The highest-performing approach (Score: 0.87) discards complex heuristics in favor of a binary Bayesian choice. It strictly evaluates two specific hypotheses (Local Measurement vs. Peer Measurement) against flow conservation constraints, achieving a superior Counter Repair Accuracy of **0.878** compared to consensus-based averages (e.g., Generation 17, 23 at ~0.81).
- **Normalized Probability Calibration:** The Current Best Program effectively converts raw conservation scores into reliable confidence values using a normalized ratio ($P_{winner} = S_{winner} / \sum S_{all}$). This yields a calibration score of **0.806**, significantly outperforming programs like Generation 25 (0.413) and Generation 18 (0.62) which relied on raw exponential scores that did not map linearly to error probabilities.
- **Traffic-Driven Status Inference:** Consistently across all high-scoring programs (Current Best, Gen 20, Gen 28), the logic of overriding a reported 'down' status when repaired traffic exceeds a minimal threshold (e.g., `> 0.5`) has solved the status repair problem, consistently delivering **1.0** accuracy.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Synthetic "Computed" Candidates:** Generation 21 attempted to generate new flow values to force mathematical router balance ("computed candidates"). This resulted in a drastic drop in Counter Repair Accuracy (0.622) because the algorithm hallucinated traffic to satisfy constraints rather than arbitrating between actual noisy measurements.
- **Unscaled Confidence Scoring:** Generation 18 and Generation 25 used raw goodness-of-fit scores (derived from flow conservation) directly as confidence. This failed to account for the relative strength of competing hypotheses, leading to poor calibration (0.41 - 0.62) where high scores did not necessarily imply high certainty.
- **Heuristic Consensus Weights:** Programs relying on distance-based or weighted consensus (Generation 17, 19, 23) plateaued at ~0.81 counter accuracy. These methods struggled to resolve binary conflicts (where one side is right and the other is wrong) as effectively as the winner-take-all Bayesian approach.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations.

1.  **Integrate Conservation-Based Validation for External Links**
    The current program assigns a fixed high confidence (0.90) to external/edge links, blindly trusting them because there is no peer interface to contradict them. However, if the router hosting the external link shows significant flow imbalance, the external measurement is likely incorrect.
    **Recommendation**: Treat external links as "suspect" if the router imbalance is high. Generate a synthetic "implied value" hypothesis (`val_implied = sum(other_in) - sum(other_out)`) and let it compete against the reported measurement using the existing Bayesian scoring logic. This extends the successful hypothesis selection pattern to the network edge.

2.  **Introduce a "Zero Flow" Hypothesis for Phantom Traffic**
    Currently, the algorithm forces a choice between `val_src` and `val_dst`. In cases where a link is physically down but counters register noise ("phantom traffic"), both values are non-zero and incorrect.
    **Recommendation**: Explicitly add `0.0` as a third hypothesis in the `suspect_flows` evaluation list. If the zero hypothesis minimizes local router imbalance significantly better than the reported non-zero values (measured by the Gaussian likelihood score), the system should select `0.0` and effectively identify the link as idle/down.

3.  **Implement Absolute Goodness-of-Fit Confidence Scaling**
    The current normalization (`P = S1 / (S1 + S2)`) produces relative probabilities. If both hypotheses yield poor conservation (e.g., due to topology errors or unmodeled noise), the "winner" still gets a high confidence score, damaging calibration.
    **Recommendation**: Scale the final confidence score by the absolute magnitude of the winning likelihood score. For example, use `final_conf = relative_prob * sigmoid(raw_score_magnitude)`. This ensures that repairs which satisfy conservation constraints well receive high confidence, while "best of a bad bunch" selections receive lower confidence.

4.  **Apply Momentum-Based Estimates for Stability**
    The current iterative loop performs "hard" updates (`current_estimates = winner_val`) at each step. In complex topologies where multiple routers are correcting simultaneously, this can lead to oscillating solutions that fail to converge.
    **Recommendation**: Change the update step to a "soft" update using momentum or a learning rate: `new_val = (alpha * winner_val) + ((1 - alpha) * old_val)`. A factor of `alpha=0.5` will dampen oscillations and help the iterative solver reach a stable global equilibrium.

5.  **Adopt Non-Linear Noise Modeling (Square Root Scaling)**
    The current tolerance model (`sigma = flow * 0.03`) assumes errors scale linearly with bandwidth. However, network counter noise typically follows a Poisson-like distribution where variance scales with the square root of the flow.
    **Recommendation**: Mutate the sigma calculation to a non-linear function, such as `sigma = max(sqrt(flow) * scale_factor, 1.0)`. This prevents the algorithm from overly penalizing natural variance
