# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link Symmetry-Based Network Telemetry Repair Algorithm**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm validates telemetry using link symmetry invariants, substituting peer values when discrepancies exceed a 2% threshold and calculating confidence scores based on the magnitude of the deviation. It enforces status consistency across connected pairs but omits the documented flow conservation logic.
- **Performance**: The solution achieved a combined score of 0.83, notably reaching 1.0 accuracy in status repair and 0.826 in counter repair with good confidence calibration.
- **Feedback**: While the status checks are robust, the counter repair relies solely on peer data; implementing the missing flow conservation logic (Sum(in) = Sum(out)) would provide a necessary tie-breaker when both link ends are unreliable.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Triangulated Consensus Repair with Flow Conservation Voting**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm repairs telemetry by arbitrating between local sensors, peer link symmetry, and router-wide flow conservation, initializing flow calculations with peer data to mitigate local sensor errors.

**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name bayesian_flow_optimizer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Iterative Bayesian Flow Consensus with Imbalance Scoring**
- **Implementation**: This approach fuses link symmetry checks with an iterative Bayesian update loop that resolves suspect telemetry by selecting values that minimize router-level flow imbalance using a Gaussian likelihood function.
- **Performance**: It achieved a 0.80 combined score, delivering perfect status repair (1.00) and high counter accuracy (0.88), though confidence calibration (0.46) was moderate.

**Program Name: Calibrated Hierarchical Link-Flow Consensus**
- **Implementation**: This approach prioritizes link symmetry (peer data) for repair, using flow conservation only as a tie-breaker when local and peer values disagree and router-wide data is balanced. It uniquely employs a "decoupled confidence" strategy, assigning fixed high confidence scores based on the type of consensus reached (e.g., Peer+Flow agreement) rather than the magnitude of the repair.

# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Probabilistic Flow Consensus (Current Best):** The most successful approach (Generation 8, Score: 0.87) treats telemetry repair as a probabilistic inference problem. It evaluates "hypotheses" (local vs. peer measurements) by calculating a Gaussian likelihood score based on how well each candidate minimizes router-level flow imbalance. This outperformed greedy or combinatorial solvers (e.g., Generation 4, Score: 0.80) in counter repair accuracy (0.878 vs 0.794).
- **Normalized Likelihood for Calibration:** The best program converts raw goodness-of-fit scores (derived from flow conservation constraints) into confidence values using a normalized probability ratio ($P_1 = S_1 / (S_1 + S_2)$). This yielded a significantly higher calibration score (0.806) compared to programs that used discrete tiers (Generation 1, 0.733) or unscaled global penalties (Generation 11, 0.46).
- **Traffic-Driven Status Inference:** Consistently across all high-performing programs (Generations 0-14), achieving 1.0 status accuracy was linked to logic that overrides a reported 'down' status if the repaired traffic flow exceeds a significance threshold (e.g., `> 0.5`).
- **Symmetry-First Filtering:** Programs that first classified links as "Solid" or "Suspect" based on peer symmetry (Generation 8, 10, 14) and only applied computationally expensive flow conservation logic to the suspect links achieved high efficiency and prevented valid local data from being corrupted by noisy neighbors.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Coarse Global Penalties:** Generation 11 (Score: 0.80) attempted to penalize confidence scores based on the residual flow imbalance of the entire router. This proved too broad, resulting in a poor calibration score (0.46) because it punished accurate links on a router that had other unrelated errors.
- **Unscaled Probabilities:** While Generation 13 used a similar Bayesian approach to the best program, it failed to properly scale or normalize the likelihoods, resulting in the lowest confidence calibration (0.386). Raw likelihood scores do not translate directly to reliability probabilities without normalization against alternative hypotheses.
- **Discrete Confidence Tiers without Context:** Early generations (Generation 1, Generation 3) used static confidence values (e.g., 0.95 for agreement, 0.90 for repair). While accurate in repair, these failed to reflect the *degree* of uncertainty in difficult conflict scenarios, limiting calibration scores compared to the continuous scaling used in Generation 8.

## Implementation Insights
- **Dynamic Tolerance Scaling:** The Current Best Program (Generation 8) calculates flow conservation likelihoods using a dynamic sigma derived from the flow magnitude (`sigma = max(flow * 0.03, 1.0)`). This ensures that the algorithm remains robust for both high-bandwidth backbones and low-traffic edge links, unlike fixed-threshold approaches.
- **Synchronous Batch Updates:** The implementation of the best program accumulates updates for all suspect links and applies them simultaneously at the end of each iteration. This prevents order-of-processing bias (where repairing link A first skews the flow calculation for link B) which is common in greedy sequential solvers.
- **Hypothesis Scoring via Router intersection:** The best implementation explicitly scores a candidate value by checking its impact on *both* the source router's and destination router's flow balance. The combined score (`score_src * score_dst`) acts as a rigorous filter, as an incorrect value is unlikely to satisfy conservation constraints at two independent nodes simultaneously.

## Performance Analysis
- **Probabilistic vs. Combinatorial:** There is a clear performance tier separation between probabilistic solvers and combinatorial/greedy solvers. Bayesian/Probabilistic methods (Gen 6, 8, 12) consistently achieved counter repair accuracy in the ~0.88 range, whereas greedy or brute-force optimization methods (Gen 2, 4, 5) plateaued around ~0.79-0.81.
- **Calibration Correlation:** The Current Best Program (Gen 8) is the only one to achieve both high counter accuracy (>0.87) and high calibration (>0.80). Other high-accuracy programs like Gen 6 (0.88 accuracy) suffered from poor calibration (0.68), indicating that the *method* of calculating confidence is just as critical as the repair logic itself.
- **Status Repair Solved:** Status repair accuracy has converged to 1.0 across almost all recent generations. The logic relying on "traffic implies UP status" is optimal. Future gains must come entirely from Counter Repair Accuracy and Confidence Calibration.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Integrate Conservation Logic for External Links**: The current program trusts external/edge links blindly with a fixed confidence (0.90). However, their validity can be inferred by checking the flow balance of the router they connect to. **Recommendation**: Treat external links as "suspect" if the host router has high residual imbalance. Generate a synthetic hypothesis for the external link (e.g., `implied_value = sum(other_interfaces)`) and evaluate it using the existing Bayesian scorer to detect and repair errors at the network edge.

2.  **Introduce a "Null Flow" Hypothesis**: Currently, the algorithm forces a choice between the source measurement (`val_src`) and the destination measurement (`val_dst`). In cases of "phantom traffic" (noise on a downed link), both might be non-zero and incorrect. **Recommendation**: Add `0.0` as a third hypothesis in the `suspect_flows` evaluation. If the `0.0` value minimizes router imbalance better than the reported values, the system can correctly identify the link as idle/down, significantly aiding the status inference logic.

3.  **Absolute Goodness-of-Fit Confidence Scaling**: The current normalization ($P = S_1 / (S_1 + S_2)$) provides a relative probability, which can result in high confidence even if both hypotheses yield poor conservation (the "best of a bad bunch" problem). **Recommendation**: Scale the final confidence score by the *magnitude* of the winning likelihood score (e.g., `final_conf = P * sigmoid(raw_score)`). This ensures that repairs violating conservation constraints—even if they are the best available option—receive lower confidence scores, improving calibration.

4.  **Momentum-Based Estimate Updates**: The current implementation performs a "hard" update, setting estimates directly to the winner value at the end of each iteration. This can cause oscillations in complex topologies where multiple routers are correcting simultaneously. **Recommendation**: Implement a "soft" update rule using momentum or confidence weighting (e.g., `new_val = (winner_val * conf) + (old_val * (1 - conf))`). This dampening effect helps the iterative solver converge more stably towards a global equilibrium.

5.  **Non-Linear Noise Modeling (Sigma Mutation)**: The current tolerance model (`sigma = flow * 0.03`) assumes errors scale linearly with bandwidth. Network counter noise often follows a Poisson distribution or has a fixed noise floor. **Recommendation**: Mutate the sigma calculation to a non-linear function like `sigma = max(sqrt(flow), 1.0)` or `sigma = flow * 0.01 + constant`. A more precise noise model will sharpen the distinction between acceptable measurement variance and actual counter corruption.
