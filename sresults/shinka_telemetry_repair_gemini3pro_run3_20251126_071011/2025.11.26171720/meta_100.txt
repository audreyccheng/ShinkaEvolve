# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link Symmetry-Based Network Telemetry Repair Algorithm**

# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Mid-Convergence Adaptive Locking:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** and **Gen 95** utilized an iterative locking strategy where flows reaching high probability (`> 0.90`) at a specific iteration (e.g., iteration 3) are frozen as "Anchors." This reduces the search space and effectively propagates constraints from reliable network sections to noisy ones, contributing to Gen 92's top combined score of **0.93**.
- **Discrete Hypothesis Restriction:** **Gen 91** achieved the highest specific counter repair accuracy (**0.945**) by removing averaged values from the hypothesis space, forcing the solver to choose strictly between measurement candidates or zero. This approach prevents the algorithm from fabricating artificial "compromise" values that satisfy conservation but deviate from ground truth.
- **Traffic-Magnitude Weighted Reliability:** **Gen 94** (Score 0.91) successfully weighted router reliability anchors by the log-scale of traffic magnitude. This ensured that high-volume links, which typically have better signal-to-noise ratios, drove the flow conservation logic, resulting in robust repairs (Counter Accuracy 0.921).

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Unbounded Linear Confidence Models:** **Gen 96** attempted to use a linear fitness model to avoid the "punitive" nature of harmonic means but resulted in a mediocre calibration score of **0.67**. The linear scaling failed to capture the non-linear increase in uncertainty when conservation errors grew, leading to overconfidence.
- **Over-Optimistic Dynamic Weighting:** **Gen 93** and **Gen 97** achieved good accuracy scores (~0.93 status, ~0.88 counter) by dynamically weighting priors with router reliability, but suffered from poor calibration (0.634 and 0.83 respectively). The algorithms placed too much trust in "reliable" routers, failing to account for the possibility of occasional errors on otherwise trusted devices.
- **Indiscriminate Averaging:** The comparative success of **Gen 91** (Discrete hypotheses) over earlier iterations suggests that including averages of conflicting measurements as a default hypothesis often degrades performance. It allows the solver to find "mathematically convenient" values that satisfy local constraints but do not reflect the actual traffic flow.

## Implementation Insights
- **Conditional Harmonic Mean Calibration:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** implements a bifurcated calibration logic: if the repaired value is close to the original measurement (`is_close`), confidence is based on router fit (`0.8 + 0.15 * effective_fit`). If the value changes significantly, it uses the harmonic mean of solver probability and router fit. This prevents the metric from unfairly penalizing correct data while rigorously flagging uncertain repairs.
- **Reliability-Scaled Noise Model:** **Gen 92** defines `sigma` as `base * (2.0 - reliability)`. This implementation detail effectively doubles the error tolerance for unreliable routers (`reliability=0.0`) while enforcing strict conservation (1.0x sigma) on trusted routers. This creates a "Trust Transfer" effect where reliable neighbors force correction on unreliable ones.
- **Recursive Neighbor Trust:** **Gen 99** and **Gen 98** explicitly incorporated neighbor stability into local trust calculations. Gen 99 penalized interfaces connected to peers with poor flow conservation, preventing the propagation of bad data from "contagious" noisy neighbors.

## Performance Analysis
- **Accuracy Ceiling vs. Calibration:** Counter repair accuracy has plateaued at approximately **0.945** (Gen 91, Gen 96, Gen 92). The differentiating factor for the **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** was its superior calibration (**0.875**) compared to the accuracy-focused Gen 91 (**0.749**). This indicates that accurately quantifying uncertainty is now more critical for maximizing the combined score than marginal accuracy gains.
- **Impact of Discrete Constraints:** Programs enforcing discrete choices (Gen 91) or highly selective averages (Gen 92) consistently outperformed those allowing free-form values. Gen 91's 0.945 counter accuracy highlights that in telemetry repair, the truth is almost always one of the measured values or zero, rather than an arbitrary average.
- **Solved Status Repair:** Across all high-performing programs (Gen 90-99), status repair accuracy is consistently **1.0**. The combination of traffic thresholding (e.g., `> 0.5`) and checking peer interface status has effectively solved the status repair sub-problem.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** and the global insights from previous generations, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Strict Discrete Hypothesis Enforcement**
    In `Step 2` (Internal Flow Logic), remove the conditional block that adds the average of two conflicting measurements (`(v1+v2)/2.0`) to the candidate list. Analysis of **Gen 91** (Counter Accuracy 0.945) vs **Gen 92** (Counter Accuracy 0.944) suggests that removing "compromise" values forces the solver to identify the correct source measurement, leveraging the fact that telemetry errors are typically discrete (one side is right, one is wrong) rather than averaged distortions.

2.  **Source-Reliability Biased Priors**
    Modify the prior initialization for internal flows to bias the solver toward candidates from more reliable routers. Instead of initializing all non-zero measurement candidates with uniform priors or simple distance metrics, assign a higher initial probability (e.g., `0.7` vs `0.3`) to the candidate originating from the router with the higher `router_anchor_strength`. This utilizes the "Trust Transfer" insight earlier in the pipeline, guiding the solver correctly before conservation constraints are applied.

3.  **Low-Probability Hypothesis Pruning**
    Implement a "cleanup phase" at the end of the `LOCKING_ITERATION`. Iterate through all `suspect_flows` and permanently remove any hypothesis candidates (including the `0.0` or measurement options) that have an accumulated probability mass below a strict threshold (e.g., `< 0.05`). This prevents the solver from wasting probability mass on "zombie" hypotheses in later iterations, thereby improving the final confidence calibration.

4.  **Log-Weighted Anchor Reliability**
    Change the `router_anchor_strength` calculation to weight flows by the logarithm of their magnitude (`math.log(flow + 1.0)`) rather than the linear value. Currently, a single high-bandwidth core link can dominate the reliability score, masking errors on numerous smaller access links. Log-weighting ensures that a router is deemed reliable only if it maintains consistency across a diverse set of interfaces, improving the robustness of the reliability metric.

5.  **Recursive Neighbor-Reliability Penalty**
    Introduce a recursive penalty to `router_anchor_strength` where a router's score is dampened if its neighbors have low reliability scores. Calculate a `neighbor_trust_factor` (average of peers' reliability) and multiply the local anchor score by this factor (e.g., `local_score * (0.5 + 0.5 * neighbor_trust_factor)`). This prevents "contagious" clusters of bad telemetry from being marked as reliable simply because they are internally consistent with each other.
