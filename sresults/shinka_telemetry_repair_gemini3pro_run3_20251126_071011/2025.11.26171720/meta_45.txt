# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Binary Hypothesis Testing (Current Best):** The most effective strategy (Combined Score: 0.87) abandoned complex candidate generation in favor of a strict binary choice between specific measured values (`val_src` vs `val_dst`). By evaluating only these two existing data points against router conservation constraints, the **Current Best Program** achieved a superior Counter Repair Accuracy of **0.878**, significantly outperforming approaches that averaged values or generated synthetic candidates (e.g., Gen 34 at 0.772).
- **Iterative Bayesian Refinement:** High-scoring programs like **Generation 43** (Score: 0.85) and the **Current Best** utilize an iterative loop (typically 5 iterations) to repeatedly update flow estimates. This allows local decisions to propagate across the network, resolving complex multi-hop imbalances more effectively than single-pass logic.
- **Traffic-Driven Status Inference:** A consistent winner across all top programs (Current Best, Gen 36-44) is the logic to override a reported 'down' status if repaired traffic exceeds a minimal threshold (e.g., `> 0.5`). This simple heuristic consistently yields **1.000** Status Repair Accuracy.
- **Normalized Probability Calibration:** The **Current Best Program** calculates confidence as a normalized ratio of likelihood scores ($P_{winner} = S_{winner} / (S_1 + S_2)$). This approach yielded a strong Calibration score of **0.806**, unlike programs using raw heuristic scores (Gen 30, 31) which struggled with calibration (~0.60-0.78).

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Synthetic "Implied" Candidates:** **Generation 38** attempted to include "implied" and "phantom" hypotheses (values calculated to force zero balance) in its selection pool. This resulted in a drastic performance drop to a combined score of **0.65** and moderate calibration (0.443), confirming that "hallucinating" values to satisfy constraints is less accurate than arbitrating between noisy measurements.
- **Pure Constraint Solving (Gauss-Seidel):** **Generation 34** employed a Gauss-Seidel solver to generate candidates that minimize flux violations. While it achieved high status accuracy, its Counter Repair Accuracy (**0.772**) was significantly lower than the Current Best (**0.878**), suggesting that mathematical idealization of noisy networks leads to overfitting incorrect values compared to probabilistic selection.
- **Heuristic Penalties for Calibration:** Programs like **Generation 31** and **Generation 33** used heuristic penalty systems or "Fit Quality" metrics for confidence. These failed to map linearly to error probabilities, resulting in poor calibration scores (~0.60-0.64) despite decent repair accuracy.

## Implementation Insights
- **Likelihood Scoring with Flow-Dependent Sigma:** The **Current Best Program** implements a Gaussian likelihood function `exp(-|imbalance| / sigma)` where `sigma` scales with flow volume (`max(flow * 0.03, 1.0)`). This ensures that the algorithm is tolerant of larger absolute errors in high-bandwidth links while remaining strict for small flows, a critical factor in its high accuracy.
- **Restricted Search Space:** The code of the **Current Best Program** explicitly defines `candidates = [val1_tx, val2_rx]`. By restricting the solution space to exactly these two options, the algorithm avoids converging on local minima that mathematically satisfy conservation but deviate from physical reality.
- **Decoupled Confidence Logic:** **Generation 42** and the **Current Best** demonstrate that confidence should be derived from the *strength of the winning hypothesis* relative to the alternative (e.g., softmax or normalized ratio), rather than the absolute quality of the flow balance. This separation allows for high confidence even in slightly noisy (but clearly decidable) scenarios.

## Performance Analysis
- **Selection vs. Generation:** There is a clear performance gap between algorithms that *select* the best observed value (Current Best: 0.878 accuracy, Gen 43: 0.852) and those that *calculate* a new value (Gen 34: 0.772, Gen 38: 0.681). This strongly indicates that in this telemetry repair context, at least one endpoint usually reports the correct value, and synthesizing new values introduces error.
- **Calibration Trends:** The **Current Best Program** achieved a Calibration score of **0.806**, approaching the theoretical ideal. In contrast, heuristics-based consensus (Gen 30-33) clustered around 0.60-0.70. This improved calibration correlates directly with the use of a formal probabilistic framework (Bayesian updates) rather than ad-hoc scoring.
- **Convergence on 0.82-0.85:** Most robust consensus algorithms (Gen 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42) plateaued around a combined score of 0.82-0.83. The leap to **0.87** by the Current Best implies that the specific mechanism of binary hypothesis testing against conservation constraints provides the necessary edge to break this ceiling.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the global insights and the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Introduce a "Zero-Flow" Hypothesis**
    The current binary search strictly chooses between `val_src` and `val_dst`. In scenarios where a link is down but counters report "phantom traffic" (noise), both values are incorrect. Explicitly adding `0.0` as a third candidate in the `suspect_flows` list allows the Bayesian scorer to select "zero flow" if that hypothesis significantly minimizes the local router imbalance, effectively identifying down links through conservation logic.

2.  **Implement Conservation-Based External Link Validation**
    The current program blindly trusts external/edge links with a fixed confidence (0.90) because they lack a peer interface. You should modify the initialization step to check router balance: if a router with an external link shows high imbalance, treat that external link as "suspect" and generate a synthetic candidate (`sum(other_flows)`) to compete against the reported value, extending the successful consensus logic to the network edge.

3.  **Adopt Non-Linear (Square Root) Noise Modeling**
    The current likelihood function uses a linear tolerance (`sigma = flow * 0.03`), which can be too loose for high-bandwidth links and too strict for low ones. Change the sigma calculation to follow a Poisson-like distribution, such as `sigma = max(scale * sqrt(flow), 1.0)`. This more accurately models physical counter variance, improving the selection accuracy between competing hypotheses.

4.  **Apply Momentum to Iterative Updates**
    The current algorithm performs "hard" updates (`current = winner`) during its 5 iterations, which can lead to oscillation in complex topologies where multiple routers correct each other. Implement a "soft" update using a momentum factor (e.g., `alpha = 0.5`), where `new_estimate = (alpha * winner_val) + ((1 - alpha) * current_estimate)`. This dampening helps the network converge to a stable global equilibrium.

5.  **Scale Confidence by Absolute Goodness-of-Fit**
    The current confidence calculation (`P = S1 / (S1 + S2)`) is purely relative; it yields high confidence even if the "winning" hypothesis still results in poor conservation (e.g., due to topology errors). Multiply the final confidence score by a sigmoid of the raw likelihood score (e.g., `conf = relative_prob * tanh(raw_score)`). This ensures that repairs are only marked as "confident" when they actually result in a well-balanced router state.
