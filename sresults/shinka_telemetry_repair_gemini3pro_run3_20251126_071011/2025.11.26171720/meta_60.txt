# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Anchor-Suspect Classification (Key Differentiator):** The **Current Best Program (Gen 59)** and **Gen 45** broke through the previous performance plateau (reaching Combined Scores of **0.88** and **0.86** respectively) by pre-classifying links as "Anchors" (symmetric/trusted) or "Suspects". By locking in anchors and only subjecting suspects to modification, these programs achieved superior Counter Repair Accuracy (**0.917** and **0.90**) compared to global consensus models that treat all links as mutable (e.g., Gen 48 at 0.825).
- **Explicit Phantom Traffic Hypothesis:** Top-performing programs (Gen 59, Gen 49) explicitly include `0.0` as a candidate hypothesis in the solution space. This allows the Bayesian solver to mathematically select "dead link" explanations over noisy non-zero measurements, contributing to perfect Status Repair (1.0) and preventing the "hallucination" of traffic on downed interfaces.
- **Hybrid Square-Root Noise Models:** The **Current Best Program** utilizes a noise model that scales with $1.5\sqrt{flow}$ (mimicking Poisson sampling noise) combined with a linear percentage floor. This non-linear scaling proved more robust across varying traffic magnitudes than simple linear percentage models, effectively handling the heteroscedasticity of network telemetry.
- **Momentum-Based Iterative Refinement:** Programs utilizing momentum in their update loops (Gen 59, Gen 57) demonstrated greater stability. By updating estimates as `new = old * (1-m) + target * m` (with $m=0.5$), these algorithms avoided oscillation between conflicting peer measurements, allowing them to converge on more accurate values than instantaneous update methods.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Global Optimization Without Anchoring:** Algorithms that subjected the entire network to optimization simultaneously (Gen 46, 54, 58) consistently plateaued at a Counter Repair Accuracy of ~0.83. Without the "Anchor" concept to preserve known-good data, the solver tends to distribute errors from bad links onto good links to satisfy global conservation, degrading overall precision.
- **Over-Reliance on Global Fit for Confidence:** Programs like **Gen 49** and **Gen 53** derived confidence scores primarily from the final flow conservation fit of the router. This led to poor Calibration scores (0.40 - 0.47) because a router can be globally balanced even if individual link values are incorrect (compensating errors), or a correct link can reside on a router with *other* bad interfaces.
- **Synthetic Candidate Generation:** The evaluation reinforces that generating synthetic "implied" candidates (Gen 38, Gen 52) yields lower accuracy (~0.76) than selecting from discrete observed values. The **Current Best Program** restricts its internal search space strictly to `[val_src, val_dst, 0.0]`, confirming that arbitration is superior to calculation for this task.

## Implementation Insights
- **Restricted Discrete Hypothesis Search:** The **Current Best Program** (Gen 59) constructs a strictly limited list of hypotheses for internal links: the source measurement, the destination measurement, and zero. It does not average these values or generate intermediates. This implementation detail forces the solver to identify *which* endpoint is lying, rather than finding a mathematical compromise, which is critical for the high 0.917 accuracy.
- **Hybrid Confidence Logic:** While pure probability scores often fail calibration tests, **Gen 59** implements a hybrid confidence heuristic: Anchors get a fixed high score (0.95); repaired values inherit the router's conservation fit (`0.9 * fit`); and unchanged values get a mixture (`0.8 * fit + 0.15`). This heuristic approach outperformed pure probabilistic derivations (Gen 47, 49) in calibration scoring.
- **Adaptive Sigma Calculation:** A specific coding pattern in the best program is the sigma calculation `max(1.5 * sqrt(flow), flow * 0.02, 1.0)`. This ensures that the likelihood function remains permissive enough for high-bandwidth variance (via sqrt) while enforcing strictness on lower flows, with a hard floor to prevent division-by-zero or over-sensitivity on near-silent links.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Anchor" Performance Tier:** There is a distinct performance gap between programs using Anchor/Suspect logic (Counter Accuracy **>0.90**) and those using Weighted Consensus (Counter Accuracy **~0.83**). The ability to isolate the repair domain to only problematic links effectively effectively reduced the problem space and error propagation.
- **Calibration vs. Accuracy Trade-off:** While **Gen 51** and **Gen 54** achieved superior calibration (>0.82) using discrete confidence tiers or hypothesis selection, they lagged in repair accuracy. **Gen 59** sacrificed some calibration perfection (0.72) for significantly higher repair accuracy (0.917), resulting in the highest overall combined score.
- **Convergence on Status Repair:** Status repair has effectively been solved across all competitive generations (Gen 45-59) with 1.0 accuracy. The logic `if repaired_flow > 0.5: status='up'` appears universally effective, meaning future gains must come entirely from precision counter repair and better confidence calibration.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 59) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Status-Aware Bayesian Priors**
    Currently, the solver assigns priors based solely on value magnitude (e.g., penalizing the `0.0` hypothesis if the measurement is high). You should explicitly incorporate the `interface_status` telemetry into the prior probability calculation. If `status == 'down'`, assign a significantly higher prior (e.g., 0.8) to the `0.0` hypothesis; if `status == 'up'`, penalize `0.0`. This helps the solver leverage explicit down-signals to override "phantom traffic" noise even when conservation constraints are ambiguous.

2.  **Calibrate Confidence via Hypothesis Dominance**
    The current program's calibration score (0.72) lags behind its accuracy because it relies heavily on router fit, which can be high even if the choice between two values was a "coin toss." Modify the confidence logic to calculate the **margin of victory**: `confidence = Base_Fit * (Score_Winner / (Score_Winner + Score_RunnerUp))`. This ensures that repairs are marked with lower confidence when the solver identifies multiple equally plausible explanations, improving the correlation between predicted probability and actual accuracy.

3.  **Weighted External Link Validation**
    The current program generates an "implied" candidate for external links based on router balance, but it treats all implied values equally. Refine this by scaling the *prior probability* of the implied candidate based on the ratio of "Anchor" flows to "Suspect" flows on the local router. If a router's internal environment consists mostly of trusted Anchors, the conservation-derived value for the external link is highly reliable and should effectively override the raw measurement; otherwise, it should be treated with skepticism.

4.  **Conditional "Mean" Hypothesis for Low-Discrepancy Suspects**
    Global insights show that choosing discrete values (`v1` vs `v2`) is generally superior, but it forces a choice between two slightly incorrect values when the error is just Gaussian noise. For "Suspect" links where the divergence is small (e.g., 2% < diff < 10%), explicitly add the average `(v1 + v2) / 2` to the hypothesis list. This creates a hybrid approach: strict arbitration for large contradictions (lying endpoints) and mathematical compromise for minor noise.

5.  **Mid-Course Anchor Promotion**
    Implement a two-phase solution strategy. After the initial set of iterations (e.g., iteration 3 of 5), re-evaluate the "Suspect" links. If a suspect link has converged to a state that is both symmetric (agrees with peer) and balances its routers, "promote" it to an "Anchor" (lock its value) for the remaining iterations. This progressively reduces the problem space, isolating the most stubborn/complex errors for the final solver steps and preventing late-stage oscillations.
