To improve the performance of the network telemetry repair algorithm, I will implement a refinement to the arbitration logic that incorporates continuous reliability scoring for flow signals and introduces a "Phantom Traffic" (Null Hypothesis) check.

The changes address the following recommendations:
1.  **Continuous Reliability**: Instead of a binary `flow_valid` flag, the `repair_network_telemetry` loop now calculates a continuous `reliability` score based on the router's imbalance relative to total traffic. This allows for nuanced decision-making where partially reliable flow contexts can still influence the result, especially for external links.
2.  **Phantom Traffic Detection**: The `arbitrate` function now explicitly checks if a reliable flow signal suggests zero traffic (`v_flow < abs_tol`) even when sensors report noise. This helps correctly identify and repair idle links that are reporting phantom traffic.
3.  **Robust Fallbacks**: The fallback logic for external links (no peer) is improved to use the continuous flow trust score, blending the Self and Flow values when they are reasonably close, or trusting Flow more heavily if reliability is high.

These changes are expected to improve both counter repair accuracy (by better handling edge cases and external links) and confidence calibration (by scaling confidence with the quality of the consensus and flow reliability).

continuous_reliability_consensus
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Refine the arbitration logic to use continuous flow reliability scores and handle edge cases like phantom traffic (Null Hypothesis) and external links more robustly. The iterative loop now calculates a soft reliability metric for router balance, which informs the confidence of the Flow signal in the arbitration phase.
