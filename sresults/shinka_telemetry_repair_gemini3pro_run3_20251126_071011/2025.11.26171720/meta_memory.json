  "meta_scratch_pad": "# Analysis of Program Evaluation Results\n\n## Successful Algorithmic Patterns\n- **Mid-Convergence Adaptive Locking:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** and **Gen 95** utilized an iterative locking strategy where flows reaching high probability (`> 0.90`) at a specific iteration (e.g., iteration 3) are frozen as \"Anchors.\" This reduces the search space and effectively propagates constraints from reliable network sections to noisy ones, contributing to Gen 92's top combined score of **0.93**.\n- **Discrete Hypothesis Restriction:** **Gen 91** achieved the highest specific counter repair accuracy (**0.945**) by removing averaged values from the hypothesis space, forcing the solver to choose strictly between measurement candidates or zero. This approach prevents the algorithm from fabricating artificial \"compromise\" values that satisfy conservation but deviate from ground truth.\n- **Traffic-Magnitude Weighted Reliability:** **Gen 94** (Score 0.91) successfully weighted router reliability anchors by the log-scale of traffic magnitude. This ensured that high-volume links, which typically have better signal-to-noise ratios, drove the flow conservation logic, resulting in robust repairs (Counter Accuracy 0.921).\n\n## Ineffective Approaches\n- **Unbounded Linear Confidence Models:** **Gen 96** attempted to use a linear fitness model to avoid the \"punitive\" nature of harmonic means but resulted in a mediocre calibration score of **0.67**. The linear scaling failed to capture the non-linear increase in uncertainty when conservation errors grew, leading to overconfidence.\n- **Over-Optimistic Dynamic Weighting:** **Gen 93** and **Gen 97** achieved good accuracy scores (~0.93 status, ~0.88 counter) by dynamically weighting priors with router reliability, but suffered from poor calibration (0.634 and 0.83 respectively). The algorithms placed too much trust in \"reliable\" routers, failing to account for the possibility of occasional errors on otherwise trusted devices.\n- **Indiscriminate Averaging:** The comparative success of **Gen 91** (Discrete hypotheses) over earlier iterations suggests that including averages of conflicting measurements as a default hypothesis often degrades performance. It allows the solver to find \"mathematically convenient\" values that satisfy local constraints but do not reflect the actual traffic flow.\n\n## Implementation Insights\n- **Conditional Harmonic Mean Calibration:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** implements a bifurcated calibration logic: if the repaired value is close to the original measurement (`is_close`), confidence is based on router fit (`0.8 + 0.15 * effective_fit`). If the value changes significantly, it uses the harmonic mean of solver probability and router fit. This prevents the metric from unfairly penalizing correct data while rigorously flagging uncertain repairs.\n- **Reliability-Scaled Noise Model:** **Gen 92** defines `sigma` as `base * (2.0 - reliability)`. This implementation detail effectively doubles the error tolerance for unreliable routers (`reliability=0.0`) while enforcing strict conservation (1.0x sigma) on trusted routers. This creates a \"Trust Transfer\" effect where reliable neighbors force correction on unreliable ones.\n- **Recursive Neighbor Trust:** **Gen 99** and **Gen 98** explicitly incorporated neighbor stability into local trust calculations. Gen 99 penalized interfaces connected to peers with poor flow conservation, preventing the propagation of bad data from \"contagious\" noisy neighbors.\n\n## Performance Analysis\n- **Accuracy Ceiling vs. Calibration:** Counter repair accuracy has plateaued at approximately **0.945** (Gen 91, Gen 96, Gen 92). The differentiating factor for the **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** was its superior calibration (**0.875**) compared to the accuracy-focused Gen 91 (**0.749**). This indicates that accurately quantifying uncertainty is now more critical for maximizing the combined score than marginal accuracy gains.\n- **Impact of Discrete Constraints:** Programs enforcing discrete choices (Gen 91) or highly selective averages (Gen 92) consistently outperformed those allowing free-form values. Gen 91's 0.945 counter accuracy highlights that in telemetry repair, the truth is almost always one of the measured values or zero, rather than an arbitrary average.\n- **Solved Status Repair:** Across all high-performing programs (Gen 90-99), status repair accuracy is consistently **1.0**. The combination of traffic thresholding (e.g., `> 0.5`) and checking peer interface status has effectively solved the status repair sub-problem.",
  "meta_recommendations": "Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** and the global insights from previous generations, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Strict Discrete Hypothesis Enforcement**\n    In `Step 2` (Internal Flow Logic), remove the conditional block that adds the average of two conflicting measurements (`(v1+v2)/2.0`) to the candidate list. Analysis of **Gen 91** (Counter Accuracy 0.945) vs **Gen 92** (Counter Accuracy 0.944) suggests that removing \"compromise\" values forces the solver to identify the correct source measurement, leveraging the fact that telemetry errors are typically discrete (one side is right, one is wrong) rather than averaged distortions.\n\n2.  **Source-Reliability Biased Priors**\n    Modify the prior initialization for internal flows to bias the solver toward candidates from more reliable routers. Instead of initializing all non-zero measurement candidates with uniform priors or simple distance metrics, assign a higher initial probability (e.g., `0.7` vs `0.3`) to the candidate originating from the router with the higher `router_anchor_strength`. This utilizes the \"Trust Transfer\" insight earlier in the pipeline, guiding the solver correctly before conservation constraints are applied.\n\n3.  **Low-Probability Hypothesis Pruning**\n    Implement a \"cleanup phase\" at the end of the `LOCKING_ITERATION`. Iterate through all `suspect_flows` and permanently remove any hypothesis candidates (including the `0.0` or measurement options) that have an accumulated probability mass below a strict threshold (e.g., `< 0.05`). This prevents the solver from wasting probability mass on \"zombie\" hypotheses in later iterations, thereby improving the final confidence calibration.\n\n4.  **Log-Weighted Anchor Reliability**\n    Change the `router_anchor_strength` calculation to weight flows by the logarithm of their magnitude (`math.log(flow + 1.0)`) rather than the linear value. Currently, a single high-bandwidth core link can dominate the reliability score, masking errors on numerous smaller access links. Log-weighting ensures that a router is deemed reliable only if it maintains consistency across a diverse set of interfaces, improving the robustness of the reliability metric.\n\n5.  **Recursive Neighbor-Reliability Penalty**\n    Introduce a recursive penalty to `router_anchor_strength` where a router's score is dampened if its neighbors have low reliability scores. Calculate a `neighbor_trust_factor` (average of peers' reliability) and multiply the local anchor score by this factor (e.g., `local_score * (0.5 + 0.5 * neighbor_trust_factor)`). This prevents \"contagious\" clusters of bad telemetry from being marked as reliable simply because they are internally consistent with each other.",

    "Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Integrate Conservation Logic for External Links**: The current program trusts external/edge links blindly with a fixed confidence (0.90). However, their validity can be inferred by checking the flow balance of the router they connect to. **Recommendation**: Treat external links as \"suspect\" if the host router has high residual imbalance. Generate a synthetic hypothesis for the external link (e.g., `implied_value = sum(other_interfaces)`) and evaluate it using the existing Bayesian scorer to detect and repair errors at the network edge.\n\n2.  **Introduce a \"Null Flow\" Hypothesis**: Currently, the algorithm forces a choice between the source measurement (`val_src`) and the destination measurement (`val_dst`). In cases of \"phantom traffic\" (noise on a downed link), both might be non-zero and incorrect. **Recommendation**: Add `0.0` as a third hypothesis in the `suspect_flows` evaluation. If the `0.0` value minimizes router imbalance better than the reported values, the system can correctly identify the link as idle/down, significantly aiding the status inference logic.\n\n3.  **Absolute Goodness-of-Fit Confidence Scaling**: The current normalization ($P = S_1 / (S_1 + S_2)$) provides a relative probability, which can result in high confidence even if both hypotheses yield poor conservation (the \"best of a bad bunch\" problem). **Recommendation**: Scale the final confidence score by the *magnitude* of the winning likelihood score (e.g., `final_conf = P * sigmoid(raw_score)`). This ensures that repairs violating conservation constraints\u2014even if they are the best available option\u2014receive lower confidence scores, improving calibration.\n\n4.  **Momentum-Based Estimate Updates**: The current implementation performs a \"hard\" update, setting estimates directly to the winner value at the end of each iteration. This can cause oscillations in complex topologies where multiple routers are correcting simultaneously. **Recommendation**: Implement a \"soft\" update rule using momentum or confidence weighting (e.g., `new_val = (winner_val * conf) + (old_val * (1 - conf))`). This dampening effect helps the iterative solver converge more stably towards a global equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Non-Linear Noise Modeling (Sigma Mutation)**: The current tolerance model (`sigma = flow * 0.03`) assumes errors scale linearly with bandwidth. Network counter noise often follows a Poisson distribution or has a fixed noise floor. **Recommendation**: Mutate the sigma calculation to a non-linear function like `sigma = max(sqrt(flow), 1.0)` or `sigma = flow * 0.01 + constant`. A more precise noise model will sharpen the distinction between acceptable measurement variance and actual counter corruption.",
    "Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations.\n\n1.  **Integrate Conservation-Based Validation for External Links**\n    The current program assigns a fixed high confidence (0.90) to external/edge links, blindly trusting them because there is no peer interface to contradict them. However, if the router hosting the external link shows significant flow imbalance, the external measurement is likely incorrect.\n    **Recommendation**: Treat external links as \"suspect\" if the router imbalance is high. Generate a synthetic \"implied value\" hypothesis (`val_implied = sum(other_in) - sum(other_out)`) and let it compete against the reported measurement using the existing Bayesian scoring logic. This extends the successful hypothesis selection pattern to the network edge.\n\n2.  **Introduce a \"Zero Flow\" Hypothesis for Phantom Traffic**\n    Currently, the algorithm forces a choice between `val_src` and `val_dst`. In cases where a link is physically down but counters register noise (\"phantom traffic\"), both values are non-zero and incorrect.\n    **Recommendation**: Explicitly add `0.0` as a third hypothesis in the `suspect_flows` evaluation list. If the zero hypothesis minimizes local router imbalance significantly better than the reported non-zero values (measured by the Gaussian likelihood score), the system should select `0.0` and effectively identify the link as idle/down.\n\n3.  **Implement Absolute Goodness-of-Fit Confidence Scaling**\n    The current normalization (`P = S1 / (S1 + S2)`) produces relative probabilities. If both hypotheses yield poor conservation (e.g., due to topology errors or unmodeled noise), the \"winner\" still gets a high confidence score, damaging calibration.\n    **Recommendation**: Scale the final confidence score by the absolute magnitude of the winning likelihood score. For example, use `final_conf = relative_prob * sigmoid(raw_score_magnitude)`. This ensures that repairs which satisfy conservation constraints well receive high confidence, while \"best of a bad bunch\" selections receive lower confidence.\n\n4.  **Apply Momentum-Based Estimates for Stability**\n    The current iterative loop performs \"hard\" updates (`current_estimates = winner_val`) at each step. In complex topologies where multiple routers are correcting simultaneously, this can lead to oscillating solutions that fail to converge.\n    **Recommendation**: Change the update step to a \"soft\" update using momentum or a learning rate: `new_val = (alpha * winner_val) + ((1 - alpha) * old_val)`. A factor of `alpha=0.5` will dampen oscillations and help the iterative solver reach a stable global equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Adopt Non-Linear Noise Modeling (Square Root Scaling)**\n    The current tolerance model (`sigma = flow * 0.03`) assumes errors scale linearly with bandwidth. However, network counter noise typically follows a Poisson-like distribution where variance scales with the square root of the flow.\n    **Recommendation**: Mutate the sigma calculation to a non-linear function, such as `sigma = max(sqrt(flow) * scale_factor, 1.0)`. This prevents the algorithm from overly penalizing natural variance",
    "Based on the global insights and the analysis of the current best program (Generation 8), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Introduce a \"Zero-Flow\" Hypothesis**\n    The current binary search strictly chooses between `val_src` and `val_dst`. In scenarios where a link is down but counters report \"phantom traffic\" (noise), both values are incorrect. Explicitly adding `0.0` as a third candidate in the `suspect_flows` list allows the Bayesian scorer to select \"zero flow\" if that hypothesis significantly minimizes the local router imbalance, effectively identifying down links through conservation logic.\n\n2.  **Implement Conservation-Based External Link Validation**\n    The current program blindly trusts external/edge links with a fixed confidence (0.90) because they lack a peer interface. You should modify the initialization step to check router balance: if a router with an external link shows high imbalance, treat that external link as \"suspect\" and generate a synthetic candidate (`sum(other_flows)`) to compete against the reported value, extending the successful consensus logic to the network edge.\n\n3.  **Adopt Non-Linear (Square Root) Noise Modeling**\n    The current likelihood function uses a linear tolerance (`sigma = flow * 0.03`), which can be too loose for high-bandwidth links and too strict for low ones. Change the sigma calculation to follow a Poisson-like distribution, such as `sigma = max(scale * sqrt(flow), 1.0)`. This more accurately models physical counter variance, improving the selection accuracy between competing hypotheses.\n\n4.  **Apply Momentum to Iterative Updates**\n    The current algorithm performs \"hard\" updates (`current = winner`) during its 5 iterations, which can lead to oscillation in complex topologies where multiple routers correct each other. Implement a \"soft\" update using a momentum factor (e.g., `alpha = 0.5`), where `new_estimate = (alpha * winner_val) + ((1 - alpha) * current_estimate)`. This dampening helps the network converge to a stable global equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Scale Confidence by Absolute Goodness-of-Fit**\n    The current confidence calculation (`P = S1 / (S1 + S2)`) is purely relative; it yields high confidence even if the \"winning\" hypothesis still results in poor conservation (e.g., due to topology errors). Multiply the final confidence score by a sigmoid of the raw likelihood score (e.g., `conf = relative_prob * tanh(raw_score)`). This ensures that repairs are only marked as \"confident\" when they actually result in a well-balanced router state.",
    "Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 59) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Implement Status-Aware Bayesian Priors**\n    Currently, the solver assigns priors based solely on value magnitude (e.g., penalizing the `0.0` hypothesis if the measurement is high). You should explicitly incorporate the `interface_status` telemetry into the prior probability calculation. If `status == 'down'`, assign a significantly higher prior (e.g., 0.8) to the `0.0` hypothesis; if `status == 'up'`, penalize `0.0`. This helps the solver leverage explicit down-signals to override \"phantom traffic\" noise even when conservation constraints are ambiguous.\n\n2.  **Calibrate Confidence via Hypothesis Dominance**\n    The current program's calibration score (0.72) lags behind its accuracy because it relies heavily on router fit, which can be high even if the choice between two values was a \"coin toss.\" Modify the confidence logic to calculate the **margin of victory**: `confidence = Base_Fit * (Score_Winner / (Score_Winner + Score_RunnerUp))`. This ensures that repairs are marked with lower confidence when the solver identifies multiple equally plausible explanations, improving the correlation between predicted probability and actual accuracy.\n\n3.  **Weighted External Link Validation**\n    The current program generates an \"implied\" candidate for external links based on router balance, but it treats all implied values equally. Refine this by scaling the *prior probability* of the implied candidate based on the ratio of \"Anchor\" flows to \"Suspect\" flows on the local router. If a router's internal environment consists mostly of trusted Anchors, the conservation-derived value for the external link is highly reliable and should effectively override the raw measurement; otherwise, it should be treated with skepticism.\n\n4.  **Conditional \"Mean\" Hypothesis for Low-Discrepancy Suspects**\n    Global insights show that choosing discrete values (`v1` vs `v2`) is generally superior, but it forces a choice between two slightly incorrect values when the error is just Gaussian noise. For \"Suspect\" links where the divergence is small (e.g., 2% < diff < 10%), explicitly add the average `(v1 + v2) / 2` to the hypothesis list. This creates a hybrid approach: strict arbitration for large contradictions (lying endpoints) and mathematical compromise for minor noise.\n\n5.  **Mid-Course Anchor Promotion**\n    Implement a two-phase solution strategy. After the initial set of iterations (e.g., iteration 3 of 5), re-evaluate the \"Suspect\" links. If a suspect link has converged to a state that is both symmetric (agrees with peer) and balances its routers, \"promote\" it to an \"Anchor\" (lock its value) for the remaining iterations. This progressively reduces the problem space, isolating the most stubborn/complex errors for the final solver steps and preventing late-stage oscillations.",
    "Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 68) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Implement Device-Level Reliability Scores**\n    Extend the \"Anchor Score\" concept (which currently evaluates trust per-link based on neighbors) to a global \"Device Reliability\" metric. In Phase 1, calculate the average agreement of *all* interfaces on a router with their peers. In Phase 2, use this global score to weight the `s_val` (Self) hypothesis against the `p_val` (Peer) hypothesis. This allows the solver to systematically discount telemetry from devices that are statistically noisy across the board, rather than treating every link as an isolated dispute.\n\n2.  **Variance-Adaptive Flow Sigma**\n    The current program dynamically scales the *weight* (height) of the flow hypothesis based on router balance, but uses a standard traffic-dependent `sigma` (width). You should also scale the `sigma` inversely to the router's balance score. If a router is currently imbalanced, the flow conservation target is inherently \"fuzzy\"; using a wider Gaussian (`sigma * (1.0 + (1.0 - balance))`) allows the solver to accept values that roughly balance the router without enforcing false precision.\n\n3.  **Magnitude-Dependent Phantom Flow Penalty**\n    Refine the Status-Aware Prior logic. Currently, the program applies a fixed `0.15` penalty to the `0.0` hypothesis if the interface is Up. You should scale this penalty based on the magnitude of the competing non-zero hypotheses (Self/Peer). If the alternative hypothesis suggests a massive flow (e.g., > 10Gbps), the prior probability of the `0.0` hypothesis should be practically zero (e.g., `0.01`). This prevents the model from \"repairing\" large, active flows to zero due to minor noise or conservation conflicts.\n\n4.  **External Link \"Trust Transfer\"**\n    For \"Edge\" links (interfaces without peers), the solver relies entirely on flow conservation. Enhance this by boosting the `f_weight` specifically for these links if the local router has a high \"Anchor Score.\" If a router's internal links are highly consistent with their peers, the router is trustworthy; you should significantly increase the influence of the conservation constraint (`f_weight *= 2.0`) on its external links to force them to match the verified internal traffic.\n\n5.  **Iterative Candidate Pruning (Annealing)**\n    Implement a mechanism to reduce the search space in later iterations. If a candidate hypothesis (e.g., `s_val`) accumulates negligible probability mass (e.g., < 0.05) after the 3rd iteration, remove it from the `candidates` list for the remaining iterations. This \"annealing\" process prevents the solver from oscillating back to highly improbable values in the final steps and consolidates confidence mass onto the viable solutions.",
    "Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 86) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Implement Continuous Phantom Prior Decay**\n    Replace the hard-coded thresholds for the zero-flow hypothesis (currently `> 10.0` sets prior to `0.01`) with a continuous decay function, such as `prior = 1.0 / (1.0 + math.exp(0.5 * (max_cand - 5.0)))`. Hard thresholds create \"cliffs\" where a flow of 9.9 is treated as potential noise while 10.1 is treated as a certain signal; a continuous function ensures smooth handling of borderline traffic magnitudes, reducing classification errors.\n\n2.  **Source-Reliability Weighted Priors**\n    Extend the use of the \"Router Reliability\" score beyond just scaling the conservation noise (`sigma`). Use the reliability scores of the source routers to initialize the priors for the 'Self' and 'Peer' measurement hypotheses. If Router A has high reliability (consistent anchors) and Router B has low reliability, the solver should assign a higher initial probability to Router A's measurement, biasing the solution toward the more trustworthy device before conservation logic applies.\n\n3.  **\"Trust Transfer\" for Edge Links**\n    Strengthen the logic for external (edge) links by dynamically tightening their conservation constraints based on internal consistency. If a router has a high \"Anchor Score\" (its internal links are verified and symmetric), significantly reduce the calculated `sigma` for its external links. This forces the external flows to strictly balance the verified internal traffic, effectively transferring trust from the known internal state to the unknown external state.\n\n4.  **Probability-Based Candidate Pruning**\n    Add a \"pruning\" phase to the iterative solver to eliminate noise. After the middle iteration (e.g., iteration 5), verify the probability mass of each candidate hypothesis. If a candidate (e.g., a specific measurement or the 0.0 option) has a probability below a low threshold (e.g., < 0.05), remove it from the `candidates` list for subsequent iterations. This prevents the solver from oscillating back to highly unlikely values and concentrates confidence on viable solutions.\n\n5.  **Neighbor-Consensus Calibration**\n    Refine the final confidence score calculation to include the *neighboring* router's fit. Currently, confidence is based on the local router's balance and the solver's certainty. You should multiply or average this with the `router_fit` of the peer device. This ensures that a repair is only considered \"High Confidence\" (>0.90) if it satisfies conservation laws at *both* ends of the link, preventing over-confidence in solutions that locally fit but push imbalance to a neighbor.",
    "Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Gen 92)** and the global insights from previous generations, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:\n\n1.  **Strict Discrete Hypothesis Enforcement**\n    In `Step 2` (Internal Flow Logic), remove the conditional block that adds the average of two conflicting measurements (`(v1+v2)/2.0`) to the candidate list. Analysis of **Gen 91** (Counter Accuracy 0.945) vs **Gen 92** (Counter Accuracy 0.944) suggests that removing \"compromise\" values forces the solver to identify the correct source measurement, leveraging the fact that telemetry errors are typically discrete (one side is right, one is wrong) rather than averaged distortions.\n\n2.  **Source-Reliability Biased Priors**\n    Modify the prior initialization for internal flows to bias the solver toward candidates from more reliable routers. Instead of initializing all non-zero measurement candidates with uniform priors or simple distance metrics, assign a higher initial probability (e.g., `0.7` vs `0.3`) to the candidate originating from the router with the higher `router_anchor_strength`. This utilizes the \"Trust Transfer\" insight earlier in the pipeline, guiding the solver correctly before conservation constraints are applied.\n\n3.  **Low-Probability Hypothesis Pruning**\n    Implement a \"cleanup phase\" at the end of the `LOCKING_ITERATION`. Iterate through all `suspect_flows` and permanently remove any hypothesis candidates (including the `0.0` or measurement options) that have an accumulated probability mass below a strict threshold (e.g., `< 0.05`). This prevents the solver from wasting probability mass on \"zombie\" hypotheses in later iterations, thereby improving the final confidence calibration.\n\n4.  **Log-Weighted Anchor Reliability**\n    Change the `router_anchor_strength` calculation to weight flows by the logarithm of their magnitude (`math.log(flow + 1.0)`) rather than the linear value. Currently, a single high-bandwidth core link can dominate the reliability score, masking errors on numerous smaller access links. Log-weighting ensures that a router is deemed reliable only if it maintains consistency across a diverse set of interfaces, improving the robustness of the reliability metric.\n\n5.  **Recursive Neighbor-Reliability Penalty**\n    Introduce a recursive penalty to `router_anchor_strength` where a router's score is dampened if its neighbors have low reliability scores. Calculate a `neighbor_trust_factor` (average of peers' reliability) and multiply the local anchor score by this factor (e.g., `local_score * (0.5 + 0.5 * neighbor_trust_factor)`). This prevents \"contagious\" clusters of bad telemetry from being marked as reliable simply because they are internally consistent with each other."
