"""
Expert parallelism load balancer (EPLB) for vLLM.

This module implements the core rearrangement algorithm.

The rearrangement algorithm is adapted from
[DeepSeek EPLB](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/eplb).

Please find at [#12](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/EPLB/issues/12) an example
on how the EPLB algorithm works.
