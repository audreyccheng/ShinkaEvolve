<DESCRIPTION>
Optimizes the `rebalance_experts` function by using heap data structures for both expert replica assignment and expert placement on GPUs.
1. Replica Assignment: Uses a max-heap to iteratively assign replicas to the expert with the highest load per replica, reducing complexity from O(R*E) to O(R log E) where R is redundant replicas and E is
