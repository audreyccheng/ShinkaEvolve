# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-symmetry Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair enforces a 2% link-symmetry tolerance, replacing RX/TX with peer TX/RX when violated and setting confidence as 1 − relative difference; status mismatches lower confidence and zero counters if "down" with traffic. Flow conservation is not implemented and topology is unused; metadata is passed through unchanged.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.822).
- **Feedback**: Excellent status handling drove perfect status accuracy and solid calibration; counter repair is strong but likely capped by the absence of flow-conservation (R1) and per-router aggregation. Incorporating topology-driven flow checks could further boost counter repairs and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs telemetry via pair-level link symmetry (≈2% tolerance) and traffic-based status reconciliation, then applies router-level flow conservation with confidence-weighted, bounded scaling (0.5–2.0). Outputs original/repaired values with clamped confidence scores and preserves metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.852, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.743).
- **Feedback**: Link-symmetry hardening and traffic-evidence status resolution yielded perfect status accuracy, while router-level scaling stabilized counter repairs. Confidence calibration is decent but slightly misaligned, suggesting scores may be a bit over/under-confident in some corrections.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name pair_and_router_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware Telemetry Repair via Link Symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Performs a link-level hardening pass (2% tolerance) that zeros counters when either side is down and averages with peer rates when symmetry violations exceed tolerance, followed by a router-level flow conservation pass that scales the larger aggregate (RX or TX) to match the smaller per router. Confidence blends link agreement, router imbalance, and change penalty; unknown statuses are treated as up, status is preserved, and down interfaces are forced to zero.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.78 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.758; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.829); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status handling and strong confidence calibration indicate robust status consistency and sensible confidence scaling.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Confidence-weighted, capacity-capped router redistribution delivers top counter accuracy when combined with bounded scaling and direction selection by trust.
  - Current best: Invariant-Guided Network Telemetry Repair (Generation 15, pairwise_router_redistribute_v2) achieved combined 0.86 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.870 and confidence_calibration 0.780 by redistributing with MAX_ROUTER_ADJ_FRAC=0.35, weighting by 1−confidence, and scaling only the less-trusted direction within [0.5, 2.0].
  - Consistent gains across similar designs: Topology-Guided Telemetry Repair (Gen22, pair_reconcile_router_rebalance) reached combined 0.85 with counter 0.858 and confidence 0.795; Topology-Invariant Network Telemetry Repair (Gen20, bounded_scale_additive_and_pair_reconcile) reached combined 0.84 with counter 0.864.
- Robust link symmetry hardening with a ~2% tolerance plus traffic-evidence status reconciliation stabilizes counters and yields perfect status accuracy.
  - Present in the best program (Gen15) and many strong performers (e.g., Gen29, pair_reconcile_and_logistic_conf, counter 0.877; Gen17, bounded_multistep_ramp_and_pair_reconcile, counter 0.863), all with status_repair_accuracy 1.000.
- Multi-component confidence calibrated from post-repair residuals (pair and router) plus change penalties balances assertiveness and calibration.
  - Gen15’s linear residual-to-confidence mapping with weights (pair 0.6, router 0.3, status 0.1) and change penalty achieved 0.780 calibration while maintaining high counter accuracy; Gen22’s similar blend reached 0.795 calibration alongside strong counters (0.858).
- Limited pairwise reconciliation and non-negativity/clamping prevent overcorrections while preserving stability.
  - Employed in Gen15 and other high performers (Gen20, Gen22), supporting strong counter repair without destabilizing low-traffic links.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Global projection/consensus schemes with relaxed projections and damping under-correct counters despite enforcing invariants.
  - Robust Global Consensus Telemetry Repair (Gen18, irls_link_router_consensus) had counter 0.564, combined 0.60; feedback cites residual mismatches and suggests iteration/tolerance sensitivity.
  - Variance-Weighted Network Telemetry Repair (Gen24, variance_weighted_consensus) severely underperformed (counter 0.150, confidence 0.117) due to damping/tolerance and heuristic variance scaling that under-corrected counters.
- Uniform or direction-agnostic router scaling (e.g., scaling the larger aggregate uniformly) lags behind weighted/capped redistribution.
  - Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Link Symmetry (Gen28, pair_reconcile_and_conf_logistic) reached counter 0.782; earlier insights note similar patterns at 0.756–0.810, all trailing weighted/capped approaches (≥0.852).
- Over-penalizing changes in confidence calibration depresses alignment.
  - Paired Scaling with Adaptive Redistribution (Gen27, paired_scaling_redistribute_v2) shows counter 0.848 but confidence 0.443; feedback attributes this to penalty stacking and conservative logistic weighting.
- Conservative logistic mappings and fixed thresholds/tolerances reduce confidence calibration without compensatory gains in counter accuracy.
  - Consensus Graph Telemetry Repair (Gen16, counter 0.763, confidence 0.657) and Flow-conserving WLS telemetry repair (Gen21, confidence 0.544) exemplify under-calibrated outcomes.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Per-router redistribution targets the less-trusted direction (based on average direction-specific confidences) and allocates deltas to lower-confidence interfaces via weights w=1−conf, with per-interface caps (≤35% of current value) and two allocation passes. This concentrates corrections where telemetry is less reliable, improving counter accuracy (0.870 in Gen15).
  - Pairwise hardening uses a 2% link symmetry threshold: average when within tolerance; otherwise, adopt the stronger peer signal. This reduces pair residuals before router-level adjustments, stabilizing values and conf levels.
  - Confidence computation blends pair and router residual components with status confidence and a change penalty tied to relative edit magnitude (weight 0.5). Linear residual mapping and rate-aware tolerances (pair 1.5×, router 2× threshold) produce solid calibration (0.780) without sacrificing counter repair.
  - Status logic uniformly anchors results: traffic-evidence “up” when any side >0.5 Mbps, strict “down ⇒ zero” even for unpaired interfaces, and minor status_conf adjustments for idle-up cases. This underpins the universal 1.000 status accuracy.
- Concrete coding patterns tied to performance:
  - Bounded multiplicative pre-scaling (0.5–2.0) followed by additive redistribution with non-negativity clamping limits instability while achieving target totals.
  - Residual computation via rel_diff uses a max denominator guard, ensuring stable behavior across low-rate links.
  - Confidence attenuation during redistribution accounts for router imbalance, per-interface delta, and scale magnitude, aligning conf with edit intensity.

## Performance Analysis
- The current best program (Gen15) leads combined score (0.86) by pairing top-tier counter accuracy (0.870) with solid calibration (0.780), maintaining perfect status (1.000). This matches earlier best patterns (previous Gen14 best with weighted_router_redistribution at combined 0.86, counter 0.870), confirming the robustness of the weighted/capped redistribution design.
- Trade-offs between counter accuracy and confidence calibration are evident:
  - Gen29 attains the highest counter accuracy (0.877) but lower calibration (0.723), yielding combined 0.85; Gen22 posts the best calibration among recent strong candidates (0.795) with slightly lower counter (0.858), also combined 0.85. Gen15 strikes a balanced peak.
- Projection/consensus formulations trail targeted redistribution in counter accuracy:
  - Gen18 (counter 0.564) and Gen24 (counter 0.150) underperform substantially relative to redistribution-based methods (≥0.858), indicating that soft global projections with damping/relaxation failed to close counter residuals sufficiently within constraints.
- Confidence calibration patterns correlate with mapping and penalties:
  - Linear residual mapping with measured change penalties (Gen15: 0.780; Gen22: 0.795) aligns better than conservative logistic mappings or heavy penalty stacking (Gen16: 0.657; Gen21: 0.544; Gen27: 0.443), especially when paired with strong counter corrections.
- Status accuracy is saturated at 1.000 across nearly all implementations due to consistent traffic-evidence reconciliation and “down ⇒ zero” enforcement, making counter repair strategy and confidence calibration the key differentiators among top programs.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add an imbalance-tuned, bounded multiplicative pre-step before the current additive redistribution. For the less-trusted direction, compute s_bounded = clamp(sum_other_dir/sum_this_dir, 0.5, 2.0) and apply v <- v * (1 + alpha*(s_bounded - 1)) with alpha = clamp(imbalance/0.15, 0.25, 0.6) and a per-interface multiplicative cap of ±15% (and absolute delta cap 0.15*max(v, 1.0)). Recompute totals and then run the existing confidence-weighted additive pass; if avg TX/RX confidences are within 0.05, break ties by choosing the direction with the larger absolute imbalance.

2. Make per-interface caps adaptive across passes and enforce a per-router total delta guard. Use staged caps: 0.25 on pass 1, 0.35 on pass 2, and an optional pass 3 up to 0.45 only for interfaces with conf_dir < 0.6 or baseline v < 5 Mbps; also cap the router’s total absolute delta to 25% of its up-traffic (|sum delta| ≤ 0.25*(sum_tx+sum_rx)/2). Reuse capacity across passes (recompute need and weights after each pass), and freeze interfaces that have already absorbed >80% of their cap unless no other capacity remains.

3. Enrich redistribution weights with pair residuals and imbalance attribution while protecting near-zero and cap-hit links. For the scaled direction, set weight w_i = 0.6*(1 - conf_dir_i) + 0.25*(pair_residual_i/TOL_PAIR) + 0.15*(v_i/sum_v), halving w_i when v_i < 1 Mbps and reducing w_i by 30% on subsequent passes if the interface consumed >70% of its cap on a prior pass. This focuses corrections on least-trusted, most-inconsistent edges while avoiding over-pushing tiny or already-stressed links.

4. Run a targeted post-redistribution pair reconcile only on pairs touched by router edits. Track edited interfaces (delta_rel > 0); for their pairs with residual > tol_pair_post = max(0.02, 2.5/max(traffic, 1.0)), pull both ends 20–30% toward each other in each direction, respecting remaining per-interface cap (≤0.2*v) and non-negativity. Apply a mild additional confidence penalty proportional to the reconciliation move (e.g., conf *= 1 - 0.3*(residual/TOL_PAIR) clipped to [0,1]) to maintain calibration.

5. Refine confidence calibration with a two-slope residual mapping plus explicit cap-hit/scale penalties and a no-edit bonus. Replace the linear map with: x = residual/tol; conf = 1 - min(1, x/5), and if x > 3, subtract an extra 0.1*(x - 3)/2 (
