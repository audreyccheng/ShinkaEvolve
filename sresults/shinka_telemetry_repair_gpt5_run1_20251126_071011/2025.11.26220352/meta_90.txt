# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-symmetry Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair enforces a 2% link-symmetry tolerance, replacing RX/TX with peer TX/RX when violated and setting confidence as 1 − relative difference; status mismatches lower confidence and zero counters if "down" with traffic. Flow conservation is not implemented and topology is unused; metadata is passed through unchanged.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.822).
- **Feedback**: Excellent status handling drove perfect status accuracy and solid calibration; counter repair is strong but likely capped by the absence of flow-conservation (R1) and per-router aggregation. Incorporating topology-driven flow checks could further boost counter repairs and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.80 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.774; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.824).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong confidence calibration indicate stable, well-calibrated edits; counter repair slightly lags, likely due to conservative per-interface caps and clamped scaling that limit correction of large imbalances. Relaxing caps or adapting move fractions could reduce residual asymmetries and lift counter accuracy without sacrificing stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 68 - Patch Name hodor_routerpair_mix_v4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Flow/Symmetry Constraints**
- **Implementation**: Resolves interface status via redundancy plus traffic evidence, hardens link symmetry, and enforces per-router flow conservation using a multiplicative pre-step followed by staged, capacity-capped additive redistribution with guarded budgets and residual-weighted allocations. Applies asymmetric pair reconciliation based on confidence and remaining caps, then calibrates confidence using pair/router residuals, edit intensity, scale penalties, and no-edit bonuses.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.86 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.869; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.795).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair confirms robust status reconciliation and link-down handling; strong counter repair indicates the multi-stage redistribution and asymmetric pair tuning are effective. Confidence calibration trails slightly, suggesting potential tuning of residual-to-confidence mapping and penalty scaling, especially for small links.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name staged_elastic_guard_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Invariant-Guided Network Telemetry Repair with Router Balancing**
- **Implementation**: Builds peer pairs from connected_to, hardens link symmetry with tolerance-aware averaging or stronger-peer selection, and enforces “down implies zero.” Applies router-level flow conservation via a bounded multiplicative pre-step (±15% per-interface) followed by staged, capacity-capped additive redistribution under a router delta guard, then asymmetric pair reconciliation and edit-aware, invariant-weighted confidence calibration.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.824, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.821.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects effective status consensus and enforcement across pairs. Remaining counter and confidence gaps likely stem from conservative caps/weights; modest tuning of staged capacities or reconciliation aggressiveness could improve convergence while preserving stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name asymmetric_reconcile_dynamic_guard_conf_calibration - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Staged Network Telemetry Repair with Confidence Calibration**
- **Implementation**: Four-stage pipeline: status-aware link hardening, router-level multiplicative scaling (±15% bounded) with staged additive redistribution (caps 0.25/0.35/≤0.45), targeted peer reconciliation with remaining per-interface budgets, and multi-factor confidence scoring with penalties/bonuses. Uses traffic-aware pair tolerances, residual-driven direction selection, per-interface cap tracking, and enforces down→zero invariant.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.772; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.715); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong status handling and symmetry/flow constraints yield perfect status accuracy and solid counter repair, but conservative caps and “touched-only” pair reconciliation can leave residual imbalances and slightly damp confidence calibration. Consider relaxing additive caps in low-traffic/high-imbalance scenarios or tuning confidence penalties to better align with acceptable residuals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name hodor_pipeline_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Staged Network Telemetry Repair with Flow Conservation**
- **Implementation**: Implements a staged pipeline: pair/status hardening; router flow conservation via bounded multiplicative pre-scaling and three-pass capped additive redistribution with topology-aware weights; targeted asymmetric pair reconciliation; and residual/edit-aware confidence calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.86 (counter 0.859, status 1.000, confidence 0.825).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects effective pair/status hardening; router balancing likely drove strong counter accuracy. Confidence is solid but mildly conservative—residual mapping and cap-consumption penalties may suppress scores; easing tolerance/penalty settings could improve confidence calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name hodor_pipeline_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-pass topology-aware telemetry repair**
- **Implementation**: Three-pass repair: (1) link-level hardening with status-aware zeroing and tolerance-based peer substitution, (2) router-level flow conservation via bounded one-direction scaling per router, and (3) asymmetric pairwise reconciliation driven by suspicion and severity. Confidence combines post-repair residuals, post-imbalance, change penalties/bonuses, and pair-edit magnitudes; inputs are sanitized and metadata preserved.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.812, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.857); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Tolerance-aware substitutions and clamped scaling limited over-correction, producing strong confidence calibration and perfect status handling. Residual counter errors likely come from conservative scaling bounds, skip conditions for tiny volumes, and only reconciling pairs when both sides are up with valid peers.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.82 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.820, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.759).
- **Feedback**: Link symmetry triage and conservative router scaling produced strong counter fixes and perfect status handling, while tolerance gating prevented overcorrection.

- **Implementation**: Five-stage pipeline: normalization/hardening; guarded multi-pass router redistribution with per-router guard (15–35%), per-interface caps (15% lifted to 45% on low-confidence), skew-aware guard adjustment (HHI), and a multiplicative pre-step; pair-wise asymmetric residual-proportional reconciliation under 20% pair budgets; and confidence calibration from link residuals, router imbalance, edit magnitude, and improvement bonuses. Preserves I/O, zeroes down interfaces, and uses residual-aware tolerances with capped edits.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.764, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.759).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status accuracy reflects effective status-aware zeroing and peer-consistency alignment.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.81 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.805; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.775); program passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Conservative, topology-informed status handling (zeroing when down and peer consistency) achieved perfect status accuracy, while clamped router scaling and asymmetric reconciliation improved counter alignment. Confidence calibration is strong but could be further tuned (e.g., tolerance/weight parameters) to tighten alignment between confidence and residual errors.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Trust-driven router scaling with an explicit router delta guard and uncertainty-weighted redistribution is the top performer
  - Current best program (Combined 0.88; counter_repair_accuracy 0.885; confidence_calibration 0.813; status_repair_accuracy 1.000) scales the less-trusted direction (avg direction-specific confidences), uses weights from 1−confidence (0.6), pair residuals normalized by tolerance (0.25), and volume share (0.15), caps per-interface moves at 35%, and enforces a router_total_delta_guard of 25% of average up traffic. This combination outperforms strong contenders like “Topology-Driven Telemetry Repair with Confidence” (0.87 combined, counter 0.880, conf 0.782) and “Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair” Gen86 (0.86 combined, counter 0.875, conf 0.750).
- Two-stage symmetry enforcement: pre-router link hardening plus post-router, tolerance-gated pair reconciliation
  - The best program uses a ~2% hardening threshold with peer substitution/averaging and a post-pass pair reconciliation (alpha ≈ 0.30; 20% per-interface caps; rate-aware tolerances). Similar patterns drive strong counter results in “Topology-aware Network Telemetry Repair” Gen82 (0.83 combined; counter 0.829) and “topology-aware telemetry repair and confidence scoring” Gen84 (0.85 combined; counter 0.863).
- Status-aware zeroing and peer-consistency handling saturate status accuracy
  - All high scorers achieve 1.000 status_repair_accuracy via “down ⇒ 0” and traffic-evidence status resolution (e.g., Gen84/85/87/88/89 at 1.000).
- Measured confidence calibration tied to post-repair residuals with lightweight, active penalties
  - The best program’s two-slope residual-to-confidence mapping, multiplicative edit penalties scaled by edit beyond the hardening threshold, small cap-hit deductions, and a no-edit bonus produce strong calibration (0.813), better than penalty-heavy peers (e.g., Gen85 at 0.754; Gen87/89 at 0.782).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Overly conservative caps/guards and fragmented multi-pass redistribution limit counter repair
  - “Guarded Multi-Pass Telemetry Repair Pipeline” Gen78 (five stages; per-interface caps 15% lifted to 45% on low-confidence; router guard 15–35%) scores only 0.77 combined (counter 0.764), with feedback pointing to conservative guards/tolerances and per-interface caps constraining corrections.
- Heavy or inactive confidence penalty stacks depress calibration without counter gains
  - Gen75 reports an inert bounded router ratio penalty (clamped) and posts 0.759 confidence; Gen89/Gen87 cite conservative multi-penalty confidence schemes leading to 0.782 calibration despite strong counter repair (0.865/0.880); Gen85’s aggressive penalties correlate with 0.754 confidence.
- Tight scaling bounds and conservative tolerances trade counter accuracy for calibration
  - “Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Symmetry and Conservation” Gen80 clamps scaling to [0.85, 1.15] and maintains stricter tolerances; it attains high calibration (0.859) but lower counter accuracy (0.812) and combined 0.83, underperforming programs that relax bounds within guarded budgets.
- Direction-agnostic or uniform scaling underperforms vs trust-driven direction selection (from prior runs)
  - Earlier generations without uncertainty-weighted direction choice clustered at lower combined scores (~0.79–0.83), reinforcing the advantage of scaling the less-trusted aggregate.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective
  - Router redistribution is both targeted and safeguarded: scales the less-trusted side, uses composite weights (1−conf 0.6 + pair residual 0.25 + volume 0.15), applies per-interface caps (35%), and enforces a router_total_delta_guard (25% of avg up traffic), with two allocation passes and eligibility sets. This delivers the top counter accuracy (0.885) while keeping calibration high (0.813).
  - Two-stage symmetry with rate-aware tolerances: a ~2% pair hardening threshold and post-router reconciliation (alpha 0.30; 20% caps; tolerance ~max(0.02, 2.5/traffic)) closes asymmetries without overshoot, matching successful designs in Gen84 (counter 0.863) and Gen82 (counter 0.829).
  - Confidence computed from post-repair residuals with active, moderated penalties: two-slope residual mapping plus multiplicative edit penalties (scaled by deviation beyond hardening), cap-hit downticks, and a no-edit bonus improve calibration relative to heavier, stacked penalties in Gen85/87/89.
  - Robust low-rate stability and status logic: guarded rel_diff denominators (EPS), non-negativity clamps, and a universal “down ⇒ 0” rule (also for unpaired links) underlie the consistent 1.000 status accuracy across programs.
  
## Performance Analysis
- Best vs top contenders
  - The current best (0.88 combined; 0.885 counter; 0.813 conf; 1.000 status) edges “Topology-Driven Telemetry Repair with Confidence” Gen87 (0.87 combined; 0.880 counter; 0.782 conf) by +0.005 counter and +0.031 confidence, and “Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair” Gen86 (0.86 combined; 0.875 counter; 0.750 conf) by +0.010 counter and +0.063 confidence, indicating superior calibration without sacrificing counter accuracy.
- Confidence–accuracy trade-off persists across designs

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add a targeted multiplicative pre-step on the less-trusted direction before the additive pass. Compute s_bounded = clamp(sum_other_dir/sum_this_dir, 0.6, 1.7) and apply v_i <- v_i * (1 + alpha*(s_bounded − 1)) only to interfaces in the bottom 40% of dir-specific confidence or with pair_resid > tol_pair, where alpha = clamp(imbalance/0.12, 0.25, 0.55). Enforce per-interface multiplicative caps of ±12–15% and |Δ| ≤ 0.15*max(v_i, 1.0), then recompute router totals and proceed with the current uncertainty-weighted additive redistribution.

2. Make the router_total_delta_guard elastic and per-direction with skew fairness. Set guard_frac = clamp(0.18 + 0.45*imbalance + 0.30*abs(avg_tx_conf − avg_rx_conf), 0.18, 0.36), split into per-direction guards (guard_rx/guard_tx), and reduce the active guard by 15–20% if the scaled direction’s HHI (sum((v_i/sum_v)^2)) > 0.60 to avoid concentrating moves on a single port. If after pass 1 residual need remains >50% while router_delta_used < 0.6*guard, temporarily lift per-interface caps to 0.45 for links with dir_conf < 0.6 and freeze interfaces that consumed >80% of their cumulative cap unless no other capacity exists.

3. Reweight redistribution across passes with tiny-link protection and fairness dampening. In the scaled direction use tol_pair = max(0.02, 2.5/max(v_i, 1.0)) and w_i = 0.6*(1−conf_dir_i) + 0.25*min(2.0, pair_resid_i/tol_pair) + 0.15*(v_i/sum_v), then halve w_i when v_i < 1 Mbps and reduce w_i by 30% on later passes if the interface already consumed >70% of its cap; add a +0.1 boost when pair_resid_i > 2*tol_pair and a hard floor of 0.02. Recompute weights each pass to reflect updated residuals and cap consumption, ensuring distributions adapt as corrections progress.

4. Use asymmetric, residual-proportional pair reconciliation limited to touched pairs and remaining budget. For each touched pair, compute remaining_cap_dir_i = 0.20*max(pre_router_dir_i, 1.0) − abs(router_delta_dir_i) (clamped at ≥0), set alpha_low = 0.40 for the lower-confidence endpoint and alpha_high = 0.20 for the higher-confidence endpoint, and scale both alphas by min(2.0, residual/tol_pair_post); run up to two micro-iterations with early stop once residual ≤ tol_pair_post. Skip untouched pairs to preserve the no-edit bonus and keep cumulative per-interface change across all stages ≤ 0.45*max(pre_router_dir_i, 1.0).

5. Refine confidence calibration with explicit scale/guard/cap signals and an improvement bonus. In finalize_conf, subtract 0.03 if |1−s_bounded_router| > 0.25 and up to 0.05 extra if router_delta_used ≥ 0.9*router_delta_guard; subtract 0.04 when an interface consumed >70% of its cumulative cap across passes, and taper the edit penalty weight to 0.4 for edit_rel < 0.15 and 0.55 beyond. Add a +0.03–0.05 bonus when both pair residuals drop by ≥50% and the router imbalance decreases by ≥30%, which improves calibration without the heavy, counter-accuracy-hurting penalties seen in weaker designs.
