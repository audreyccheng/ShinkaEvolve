# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-symmetry Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair enforces a 2% link-symmetry tolerance, replacing RX/TX with peer TX/RX when violated and setting confidence as 1 − relative difference; status mismatches lower confidence and zero counters if "down" with traffic. Flow conservation is not implemented and topology is unused; metadata is passed through unchanged.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.822).
- **Feedback**: Excellent status handling drove perfect status accuracy and solid calibration; counter repair is strong but likely capped by the absence of flow-conservation (R1) and per-router aggregation. Incorporating topology-driven flow checks could further boost counter repairs and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**

- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects robust status reconciliation and down-implies-zero enforcement, while strong counter repair comes from pair symmetry and router redistribution. Confidence calibration lags slightly, likely due to conservative residual-to-confidence mapping and edit penalties, and per-interface caps may limit full convergence under extreme imbalances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name mult_prestep_pair_reconcile_conf_tuning - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Link-Symmetric, Flow-Conserving Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Applies pairwise link symmetry to reconcile a.tx with b.rx (and vice versa), enforces “down implies zero traffic,” and performs router-level flow conservation via capped multiplicative pre-scaling and weighted additive redistribution. Post-redistribution pair reconciliation and a composite confidence model (pair residuals, router imbalance, status, and change penalties) finalize repaired values and confidences, returning (original, repaired, confidence) tuples per field.

- **Implementation**: Three-stage repair using invariants: link-level hardening with status-aware zeroing and targeted substitution; router-level flow conservation via bounded multiplicative scaling (±15%) and uncertainty-weighted additive redistribution with per-interface caps; and selective pair reconciliation (with rate-aware tolerances) only when router edits touched a link. Confidence combines post-pair residuals, router imbalance, magnitude-of-change penalties/bonuses, and penalties for heavy scaling/pair moves, all clamped to [0,1].
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.79 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.791, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.748); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong status accuracy stems from explicit status normalization and zeroing plus consistency checks, while counter accuracy benefits from targeted substitutions, rate-aware tolerances, and conservative per-interface caps that prevent overshoot.

**Program Identifier:** Generation 55 - Patch Name hodor_pipeline_v2 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Global router-balanced link symmetrizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds bidirectional arcs for connected pairs (and separate arcs for unpaired), then uses capped gradient descent to minimize per-router flow imbalance with L2 regularization toward original rates, enforcing non-negativity and strict link symmetry.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.11 (status_repair_accuracy 1.000, counter_repair_accuracy 0.045, confidence_calibration 0.112); program passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The status heuristic is robust, but counter repair is weak, indicating factor weighting/scaling or solver tuning (e.g., stronger pair/router constraints, better normalization or preconditioning) may be needed to move values meaningfully from anchors. Confidence calibration is modest; leveraging residuals more directly and refining bonuses/penalties could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 59 - Patch Name lsq_factor_graph - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Uncertainty-weighted, capacity-capped router redistribution with a router-wide delta guard and trust-driven direction selection
  - Current best: Topology-aware Telemetry Repair via Invariants (Gen51, combined 0.88; counter 0.885; conf 0.813; status 1.000) scales the less-trusted direction (via avg direction-specific confidences), then redistributes additively with per-interface caps (MAX_ROUTER_ADJ_FRAC=0.35), bounded scaling (0.5–2.0), and a router_total_delta_guard (25% of avg up traffic). This pattern improves both counter accuracy and confidence versus prior bests (Gen39/40 combined 0.86; counter 0.877; conf 0.779).
  - Similar router weighting without a router delta guard scored well but lower: Gen46/47/49 (combined 0.82; counter 0.817–0.824; conf 0.763–0.773), indicating the guard contributed to calibration/accuracy stability.
- Robust link symmetry hardening and status evidence normalization pre-router
  - Consistently perfect status (1.000) across top performers (Gen46–49, Gen51, Gen58) came from status-aware zeroing (“down ⇒ 0”), traffic evidence for unknown/disagreeing status, and 2% symmetry tolerance with direct peer substitution/averaging.
- Tolerance-gated, capped pair reconciliation post-router
  - Gen51 uses adaptive tolerance (≈max(0.02, 2.5/traffic)), alpha ≈ 0.30, and 20% per-interface caps, closing residual asymmetries without overshoot. Comparable approaches appear in 46–49 (combined 0.79–0.82) and 58 (combined 0.85; counter 0.870), reinforcing this pattern.
- Multi-component confidence calibrated from post-repair residuals with measured penalties and a no-edit bonus
  - Gen51 blends pair (w=0.6), router (w=0.3), and status (w=0.1) components using a two-slope residual-to-confidence mapping, then applies multiplicative edit penalties and a small no-edit bonus (+0.05). This yields the best calibration in the cohort (0.813) while improving counter accuracy.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Validation/runtime failures due to schema or syntax issues
  - Several programs scored 0.00 with num_scenarios 0, indicating harness mismatch or syntax errors: Gen45 (interface mismatch), Gen50 (syntax error in rx_conf_acc accumulation and tuple schema issues), Gen55 (result schema mismatch), Gen57 (extra closing parentheses in clamp during pre-step). These prevent any algorithmic assessment.
- Direction-agnostic or “scale the larger aggregate uniformly” router strategies
  - Programs that do not target the less-trusted direction and/or rely on uniform scaling trail uncertainty-weighted approaches: Gen48 (combined 0.79; counter 0.786) and prior patterns (Gen34/36 in previous insights at combined 0.76–0.81; counter 0.769–0.810). Feedback cites underperformance relative to uncertainty-weighted redistribution.
- Global optimization with strong regularization or weak factor weighting
  - Global router-balanced link symmetrizer (Gen56, combined 0.69; counter 0.699; conf 0.596) and Sparse Factor-Graph Telemetry Repair (Gen59, combined 0.11; counter 0.045; conf 0.112) struggled. Feedback points to regularization strength, iteration budget, and anchor-dominated weights that limited meaningful deviation from noisy anchors, yielding weak counter repair and poor calibration.
- Over-penalized confidence schemes
  - Prior runs show stacked penalties depress calibration without counter gains (e.g., Gen32 conf 0.430). Even among high scorers, heavier penalty weights correlate with lower calibration (Gen58 conf 0.756 versus Gen51 conf 0.813), indicating benefit from measured penalties plus a no-edit bonus over aggressive stacking.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best (Gen51) effective:
  - Router redistribution targets uncertainty: weights combine 1−confidence (0.6), pair residual term (0.25), and volume share (0.15), concentrating edits on less-trusted, inconsistent links. With per-interface caps (35%), bounded scaling (0.5–2.0), and a router_total_delta_guard (25% of avg up traffic), it improves counter accuracy (0.885) and stabilizes calibration (0.813) versus earlier top patterns without the guard (Gen39/40 conf 0.779).
  - Tolerance-gated pair reconciliation uses adaptive thresholds (≈2.5/traffic, floored at 2%) and capped moves (20%, alpha 0.30), which prevents overshoot while fixing residual asymmetry, sustaining high counter accuracy across varied traffic magnitudes.
  - Confidence mapping ties directly to residuals after repair using a two-slope function, then modulates by observed edit magnitude and cap hits, and rewards untouched values. This aligns confidence with actual invariants adherence better than heavy penalty stacks.
- Concrete coding patterns linked to performance:
  - rel_diff with a guarded denominator and non-negativity clamps stabilize low-rate behavior; status-aware zeroing enforces “down ⇒ 0” everywhere.
  - Two-pass, capacity-aware allocation with eligibility sets and a router-level delta budget ensures progress toward flow conservation without destabilizing large router edits (notably absent or looser in mid-tier programs at 0.79–0.82 combined).
  - Direction selection by trust (avg tx_conf vs rx_conf) for the multiplicative pre-step aligns adjustments with the more reliable aggregate (used across Gen46–49 and Gen51; absent or weaker in lower performers).

## Performance Analysis
- Current best vs others:
  - Gen51 (0.88 combined; counter 0.885; conf 0.813; status 1.000) surpasses previous bests Gen39/40 (0.86 combined; counter 0.877; conf 0.779) by adding a router delta guard and refined confidence/weighting, improving both counter accuracy (+0.008) and calibration (+0.034).
  - Against Gen58 (0.85 combined; counter 0.870; conf 0.756), Gen51 gains in both counter (+0.015) and calibration (+0.057), suggesting its redistribution weighting and confidence tapering are better balanced than the heavier penalties in Gen58.
- Mid-tier cluster (Gen46–49, Gen52–54) achieves combined 0.79–0.82 with counter 0.785–0.824 and conf 0.748–0.773 using similar invariants but with more conservative caps or less nuanced weighting. Differences concentrate in router redistribution strategy (e.g., scaling choice, absence of router delta guard) and confidence penalty tuning.
- Alternative paradigms underperform on counters and calibration:
  - Global optimization (Gen56: counter 0.699; conf 0.596) and factor-graph (Gen59: counter 0.045; conf 0.112) approaches fail to move values sufficiently from anchors due to regularization/weighting and solver settings, despite robust status repair (1.000), underscoring that invariant-constrained, uncertainty-weighted local redistribution is more effective for this task.
- Status accuracy remains saturated at 1.000 across nearly all correct implementations due to consistent application of traffic-evidence reconciliation and strict “down ⇒ zero.” The differentiators for the combined score are router redistribution mechanics (uncertainty-weighted with caps and a delta guard) and confidence calibration design (two-slope residual mapping with measured change penalties and a no-edit bonus).

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add an imbalance-tuned multiplicative pre-step before the current additive redistribution. For the less-trusted direction, compute s_bounded = clamp(sum_other_dir/sum_this_dir, 0.5, 2.0) and apply v <- v * (1 + alpha*(s_bounded - 1)) with alpha = clamp(imbalance/0.15, 0.25, 0.6), enforcing a per-interface multiplicative cap of ±15% and absolute delta cap 0.15*max(v, 1.0). Recompute router totals and then run the existing uncertainty-weighted additive pass; when avg TX/RX confidences are within 0.05, break ties by the larger absolute imbalance.

2. Make router redistribution caps staged across passes with an elastic router delta guard. Use per-interface caps of 0.25 on pass 1, 0.35 on pass 2, and an optional pass 3 up to 0.45 for interfaces with conf_dir < 0.6 or v < 5 Mbps; freeze interfaces that have absorbed >80% of their total cap unless no other capacity remains. Keep the router_total_delta_guard but scale it to imbalance/trust: guard_frac = clamp(0.15 + 0.5*imbalance + 0.5*abs(avg_tx_conf - avg_rx_conf), 0.15, 0.35) of average up traffic.

3. Enrich redistribution weights and protect tiny or cap-stressed links. For the scaled direction, set w_i = 0.6*(1 - conf_dir_i) + 0.25*min(2.0, pair_residual_i/tol_pair) + 0.15*(v_i/sum_v), then halve w_i when v_i < 1 Mbps and reduce w_i by 30% on later passes if the interface consumed >70% of its cap earlier. Add a small boost (+0.1 absolute) to w_i when pair_residual_i > 2*tol_pair to focus on the most inconsistent edges while keeping a floor of 0.02.

4. Make pair reconciliation targeted and asymmetric, consuming only remaining per-interface budget. Track pre-router values (store pre_router_rx/tx) and per-direction router deltas; set remaining_cap_dir = 0.20*max(pre_router_dir, 1.0) - abs(router_delta_dir), then reconcile only pairs touched by router edits with alpha_low = 0.35 on the lower-confidence end and alpha_high = 0.20 on the higher-confidence end, clamped by remaining_cap_dir. Keep tol_pair_post = max(0.02, 2.5/traffic) and skip untouched pairs to preserve the no-edit calibration bonus.

5. Refine confidence calibration with explicit scale and cap-intensity penalties plus a change-penalty taper. Keep the current pair/router/status blend and two-slope mapping, then subtract 0.03–0.05 if |1−s_bounded| > 0.25 at the router (store s_bounded per router) and up to 0.08 if an interface consumed >70% of its cumulative cap across passes; add a +0.03 bonus for untouched interfaces. Taper the edit penalty: use weight 0.4 for small edits (edit_rel < 0.15) and 0.5 beyond that, improving calibration without over-penalizing modest, well-justified corrections.
