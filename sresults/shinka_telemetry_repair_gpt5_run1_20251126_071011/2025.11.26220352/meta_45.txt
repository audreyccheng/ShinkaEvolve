# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-symmetry Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair enforces a 2% link-symmetry tolerance, replacing RX/TX with peer TX/RX when violated and setting confidence as 1 − relative difference; status mismatches lower confidence and zero counters if "down" with traffic. Flow conservation is not implemented and topology is unused; metadata is passed through unchanged.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.822).
- **Feedback**: Excellent status handling drove perfect status accuracy and solid calibration; counter repair is strong but likely capped by the absence of flow-conservation (R1) and per-router aggregation. Incorporating topology-driven flow checks could further boost counter repairs and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.86 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.877; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.779).
- **Feedback**: Robust status reconciliation and conservative, capped adjustments yield perfect status accuracy and strong counter repair while avoiding overcorrection. Confidence calibration is good but somewhat conservative; tuning residual-to-confidence mapping, weights, and tolerance parameters could raise calibration beyond 0.779.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name hodor_flowcap_reconcile_v3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair with flow conservation**
- **Implementation**: Pair-level hardening resolves conflicting statuses via traffic evidence and enforces link symmetry; router-level flow conservation uses a capped multiplicative pre-step and uncertainty-weighted additive redistribution, followed by tolerance-gated pair reconciliation and final confidence computed from residuals with change/idle penalties.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.858, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.752); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Status accuracy benefits from “down implies zero traffic” and symmetry-based reconciliation. Confidence calibration trails due to conservative penalties and residual-to-confidence mapping—tuning weights/tolerances or penalty strength could improve calibration without reducing accuracy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name multiplicative_prestep_and_targeted_reconcile - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair Pipeline**
- **Implementation**: Multi-stage pipeline with normalization, pairwise link hardening, router-level balancing (bounded multiplicative scaling and confidence-weighted additive redistribution with per-interface caps and router delta guard), targeted pair reconciliation, and confidence calibration.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.857, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.747.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair reflects robust status reconciliation and down-implies-zero enforcement, while strong counter repair comes from pair symmetry and router redistribution. Confidence calibration lags slightly, likely due to conservative residual-to-confidence mapping and edit penalties, and per-interface caps may limit full convergence under extreme imbalances.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Uncertainty-weighted, capacity-capped router redistribution with bounded scaling and direction selection by trust consistently delivered top counter accuracy.
  - Current best: Invariant-Based Network Telemetry Repair (Gen39, pair_reconcile_and_conf_calibration) and Invariant-based network telemetry repair (Gen40, hodor_flowcap_reconcile_v3) both reached combined 0.86 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.877 and confidence_calibration 0.779 by redistributing with MAX_ROUTER_ADJ_FRAC=0.35, scaling within [0.5, 2.0], and targeting the less-trusted direction (based on avg direction-specific confidences).
  - Prior best confirmed the pattern: Invariant-Guided Network Telemetry Repair (Gen15, pairwise_router_redistribute_v2) achieved combined 0.86, counter 0.870, confidence 0.780 with the same weighted, capped redistribution targeting low-confidence interfaces.
- Robust link symmetry hardening with ~2% tolerance and traffic-evidence status reconciliation stabilized counters and saturated status accuracy.
  - Present in nearly all high performers: Gen33 (imbalance_staged_preadd_conf2slope, combined 0.86; counter 0.863; conf 0.797), Gen35 (pair_and_router_hardening, combined 0.85; counter 0.869), Gen43 (capaware_confidence_and_tracking, combined 0.85; counter 0.871).
- Post-redistribution, tolerance-gated pair reconciliation with conservative caps closed residual pair mismatches without overshooting.
  - Current best programs (Gen39/40) use suspicion/tolerance-gated moves with alpha ≈ 0.3 and 20% per-interface caps; similar staged reconciliation boosted strong performers like Gen33 and Gen41 (multiplicative_prestep_and_targeted_reconcile, combined 0.84; counter 0.858).
- Multi-component confidence calibrated from post-repair residuals (pair and router) plus measured change penalties and a no-edit bonus produced good alignment.
  - The w_pair=0.6, w_router=0.3, w_status=0.1 scheme with linear/two-slope residual mapping yielded 0.779–0.797 calibration in the top set (Gen39/40: 0.779; Gen33: 0.797; prior Gen15: 0.780).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Direction-agnostic or “scale the larger aggregate uniformly” router fixes underperformed relative to uncertainty-weighted redistribution.
  - Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Symmetry and Conservation (Gen30, symmetry_flow_harden_v3) and Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair (Gen34, tolerance_based_pair_reconcile_and_confidence) both scale only the larger aggregate and plateaued at combined 0.81 and 0.76 (counter 0.810 and 0.769), trailing weighted/capped redistributors (≥0.858).
  - Link-Symmetric Telemetry Repair with Flow Scaling (Gen36, local_zeroing_and_router_scaling_fix) had counter 0.756 and combined 0.77 despite decent confidence 0.755.
- Over-penalized confidence schemes with stacked penalties or conservative logistic mappings depressed calibration without commensurate counter gains.
  - Multi-pass Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair (Gen32, balanced_pairflow_v3) shows counter 0.754 but confidence 0.430; feedback cites conservative residual-to-confidence mapping and stacked penalties (router factor, cap hits, post-reconcile penalties).
  - Prior insights corroborate: Paired Scaling with Adaptive Redistribution (Gen27) had counter 0.848 but confidence 0.443 due to heavy penalty stacking.
- Conservative caps/thresholds and penalty stacking can dampen both counter repair and calibration.
  - Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair Pipeline (Gen42, hydra_router_pairwise_pipeline) reached combined 0.73 (counter 0.733; confidence 0.672), with feedback attributing moderation to conservative caps and penalty stacking that under-represent reliability.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective (Gen39/40):
  - Direction selection by trust at the router: compute avg tx_conf vs rx_conf and scale the less-trusted side; then apply additive redistribution weighted by w=1−conf toward the target total with per-interface caps (MAX_ROUTER_ADJ_FRAC=0.35) and 0.5–2.0 scaling bounds. This concentrates corrections on unreliable interfaces, yielding top counter accuracy (0.877).
  - Rate-aware pair hardening with a ~2% symmetry tolerance and traffic-evidence status resolution (“down implies zero” and unknown treated via evidence) reduces pair residuals pre-router and guarantees perfect status (1.000), echoing patterns from Gen15 and Gen33.
  - Tolerance-gated, capped pair reconciliation after router balancing (alpha≈0.30, caps at 20% of current values, adaptive tolerances like 2.5/traffic) closes remaining mismatches while avoiding overcorrections; used across top performers (Gen39/40, Gen33, Gen41).
  - Confidence construction blends pair and router residual components with status (weights 0.6/0.3/0.1), applies a two-slope residual mapping, includes a measured change penalty (weight 0.5) and a no-edit bonus (+0.05). This maintains 0.779 calibration alongside best-in-class counters.
- Concrete coding patterns tied to performance:
  - rel_diff with max-denominator guard stabilizes residuals on low-rate links; non-negativity clamping prevents negative counters during redistribution.
  - Two-pass weighted allocation with per-interface caps ensures target totals are approached without breaching local stability constraints; confidence is attenuated proportionally to global imbalance, per-interface relative delta, and scale magnitude (abs(1−s)).
  - Status-aware zeroing and retention of metadata are universal among high performers and underpin the saturated status_scores.

## Performance Analysis
- The current best programs (Gen39/40) achieve the highest counter_repair_accuracy (0.877) while maintaining solid confidence calibration (0.779) and perfect status (1.000), matching the top combined score 0.86 observed across runs and edging prior best counter results (Gen15 counter 0.870) without losing calibration.
- Weighted/capped router redistribution correlates strongly with higher counter scores:
  - Gen33 (imbalance_staged_preadd_conf2slope) combined 0.86 with counter 0.863 and the best calibration among this cohort (0.797); Gen35 reached combined 0.85 with counter 0.869 and calibration 0.742; Gen41/43/44 sustained 0.84–0.85 combined with counters 0.857–0.871 and calibration 0.747–0.756.
  - In contrast, programs that scaled only the larger aggregate (Gen30, Gen34, Gen36) clustered at counter 0.756–0.810 and combined 0.76–0.81.
- Confidence calibration shows a trade-off with aggressive edits and penalty stacking:
  - Strong counter results paired with moderate-to-good calibration (0.742–0.797) in high performers using linear/two-slope mappings and measured penalties (Gen33: 0.797; Gen39/40: 0.779; Gen35: 0.742). Overly conservative mappings and stacked penalties led to poor calibration without counter benefits (Gen32: 0.430).
- Status accuracy is saturated at 1.000 across nearly all implementations due to consistent application of traffic-evidence reconciliation and strict “down ⇒ zero,” making router redistribution strategy and confidence mapping the primary differentiators in combined score.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add an imbalance-tuned multiplicative pre-step before the current additive redistribution. For the less-trusted direction, compute s_bounded = clamp(sum_other_dir/sum_this_dir, 0.5, 2.0) and apply v <- v * (1 + alpha*(s_bounded - 1)) with alpha = clamp(imbalance/0.15, 0.25, 0.6), enforcing a per-interface multiplicative cap of ±15% (and absolute delta cap 0.15*max(v, 1.0)). Recompute totals and then run the existing uncertainty-weighted additive pass; when avg TX/RX confidences are within 0.05, break ties by scaling the direction with the larger absolute imbalance (supports Gen39/40’s trust-based targeting, adds Gen41-style pre-normalization).

2. Make router redistribution caps adaptive across passes and enforce a per-router total delta guard. Use staged per-interface caps: 0.25 on pass 1, 0.35 on pass 2, and an optional pass 3 up to 0.45 only for interfaces with conf_dir < 0.6 or v < 5 Mbps; also cap the router’s total absolute delta to 25% of its average traffic (|sum delta| ≤ 0.25*(sum_tx+sum_rx)/2). Reuse capacity across passes (recompute need and weights each pass), and freeze interfaces that have absorbed >80% of their total cap unless no other capacity remains, mirroring stability seen in high performers.

3. Enrich redistribution weights with pair residuals and volume share while protecting tiny and cap-stressed links. For the scaled direction, set w_i = 0.6*(1 - conf_dir_i) + 0.25*min(2.0, pair_residual_i/tol_pair) + 0.15*(v_i/sum_v); halve w_i when v_i < 1 Mbps and reduce w_i by 30% on later passes if the interface consumed >70% of its cap earlier. This focuses moves on least-trusted, most-inconsistent, and material-volume edges, extending the uncertainty-weighted pattern that drove Gen39/40’s top counter accuracy.

4. Run a targeted, asymmetrical pair reconciliation only on links touched by router edits. Track edited interfaces (delta_rel > 0) and, for those pairs with residual > tol_pair_post = max(0.02, 2.5/traffic), pull both ends toward the midpoint with alpha_low = 0.35 on the lower-confidence side and alpha_high = 0.20 on the higher-confidence side, respecting remaining per-interface cap (≤0.2*v) and non-negativity. Apply a mild confidence penalty proportional to the reconciliation move and residual only on edited sides to maintain good calibration while closing residuals (builds on Gen39/40’s tolerance-gated reconcile).

5. Refine confidence calibration with explicit scale/cap-hit penalties and a conditional change penalty taper. Keep the current w_pair/w_router/w_status blend and two-slope mapping, then subtract 0.03–0.05 if |1−s_bounded| > 0.25 at the router and up to 0.08 if an interface consumed >70% of its cap across passes; add a +0.03 bonus for interfaces untouched by router redistribution. Taper the change-penalty weight to 0.4 for small edits (delta_rel < 0.15) and keep 0.5 beyond that, matching strong-calibration schemes (Gen33/39) without over-penalizing modest, well-justified corrections.
