# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-symmetry Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair enforces a 2% link-symmetry tolerance, replacing RX/TX with peer TX/RX when violated and setting confidence as 1 − relative difference; status mismatches lower confidence and zero counters if "down" with traffic. Flow conservation is not implemented and topology is unused; metadata is passed through unchanged.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.822).
- **Feedback**: Excellent status handling drove perfect status accuracy and solid calibration; counter repair is strong but likely capped by the absence of flow-conservation (R1) and per-router aggregation. Incorporating topology-driven flow checks could further boost counter repairs and calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs telemetry via pair-level link symmetry (≈2% tolerance) and traffic-based status reconciliation, then applies router-level flow conservation with confidence-weighted, bounded scaling (0.5–2.0). Outputs original/repaired values with clamped confidence scores and preserves metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.852, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.743).
- **Feedback**: Link-symmetry hardening and traffic-evidence status resolution yielded perfect status accuracy, while router-level scaling stabilized counter repairs. Confidence calibration is decent but slightly misaligned, suggesting scores may be a bit over/under-confident in some corrections.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name pair_and_router_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware Telemetry Repair via Link Symmetry**
- **Implementation**: Performs a link-level hardening pass (2% tolerance) that zeros counters when either side is down and averages with peer rates when symmetry violations exceed tolerance, followed by a router-level flow conservation pass that scales the larger aggregate (RX or TX) to match the smaller per router. Confidence blends link agreement, router imbalance, and change penalty; unknown statuses are treated as up, status is preserved, and down interfaces are forced to zero.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.78 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.758; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.829); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status handling and strong confidence calibration indicate robust status consistency and sensible confidence scaling. Moderate counter repair accuracy suggests the per-router scaling and simple averaging may under/over-correct in some cases, though the tolerance-based adjustments effectively avoid perturbing good data.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name link_and_router_hardening_with_confidence - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence**
- **Implementation**: Uses pairwise symmetry hardening and uncertainty-weighted, capped router-level redistribution to enforce link symmetry (R3) and flow conservation (R1), with traffic-evidence-based status resolution and zeroing for down links. Key tunings include a 2% symmetry tolerance, 35% per-iteration adjustment caps over 2 iterations, and confidence calibration that blends post-repair pair/router residuals, status agreement, and a change penalty.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with 0.839 counter accuracy, perfect 1.000 status accuracy, and 0.735 confidence calibration.
- **Feedback**: Status repair is robust and counter repair strong, while confidence calibration lags, suggesting refinement of residual-to-confidence mapping and penalty scaling. The algorithm is stable and passed all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name hodor_pair_router_weighted_fusion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Implements pairwise link-symmetry hardening and status reconciliation (2% tolerance, 0.5 Mbps traffic evidence), followed by router-level flow-conservation scaling bounded between 0.5–2x. Confidence scores combine residual-based pair/router/status components with change penalties and idle-link adjustments.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.852, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.763; all tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Robust link/status logic drives perfect status repair and strong counter corrections, while confidence calibration is good but slightly miscalibrated in some cases due to linear mapping and fixed tolerances. Consider adaptive tolerances by traffic level and rebalancing pair/router weights or refining the confidence curve to tighten calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name post_repair_confidence_calibration_and_unpaired_down_enforcement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Invariant-Guided Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair: link-aware hardening with status-aware zeroing and conditional direct substitution beyond a 2% tolerance, followed by router-level flow conservation that scales only the larger aggregate across up interfaces per router. Confidence blends link agreement, router imbalance, and change penalties; status is preserved but enforced to zero rates when down.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77; counter_repair_accuracy 0.756, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.755.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair indicates strong status handling and consistent zeroing for down links; counter repair and confidence are solid with room to improve by softening direct substitutions or refining per-router scaling on low-volume cases. The program is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name hodor_crossover_link_router_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Repairs counters using link-symmetry hardening with a 2% tolerance and direct peer substitution, plus status-aware zeroing when either side is down. Applies router-level flow-conservation by scaling only RX or TX on active interfaces, and computes confidences from link agreement, router imbalance, and change penalties with status-consistency adjustments.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77; counter_repair_accuracy 0.756, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.755.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and well-calibrated confidence scores; counter repairs are strong but short of perfect, likely due to the conservative 2% threshold and uniform per-router scaling. All validation tests passed, indicating robust, consistent behavior on evaluated cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name substitution_link_fix_and_safe_router_scaling - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair: link-symmetry hardening with a 2% tolerance substitutes peer counters when mismatched, followed by router-level flow-conservation that scales RX or TX across active interfaces. Status-aware zeroing, input sanitization, and calibrated confidences combine link agreement, router imbalance, and change-penalty factors (with conservative status consistency checks).
- **Performance**: Combined 0.77; counter_repair_accuracy 0.756; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.755.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair indicates effective zeroing and conservative status treatment across links. Counter accuracy and confidence calibration are solid but could improve by refining handling when peers are missing/down and tuning the 2% hardening threshold or scaling policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name peer_substitution_and_safe_router_scaling - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Invariant-Based Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass approach: a peer-aware pre-pass with status-aware zeroing and triage substitution/averaging under a 2% tolerance, followed by router-level flow-conservation that scales only the larger aggregate (RX or TX) across up interfaces. Confidence is calibrated from link residuals, router imbalance, and correction magnitude penalties, while statuses are preserved with consistency checks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.766; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.738).
- **Feedback**: Conservative status handling and link-symmetry corrections drove perfect status accuracy and solid counter repair, with router scaling reducing systemic imbalances. Confidence estimates are reasonably calibrated but could be further refined; the 2% threshold and averaging helped harden against timing skew without overcorrection.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name hodor_hybrid_link_router_hardening - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-aware telemetry repair with peer/flow invariants**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair: link-aware hardening (status-aware zeroing, symmetry-based triage substitution/averaging) followed by router-level flow conservation with targeted single-interface scaling and uniform fallback. Confidence blends post-repair link residuals, router imbalance, and change penalty; status is preserved but confidence is adjusted for peer disagreement and counter anomalies.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.765; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.726).
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and solid counter corrections; confidence calibration is good but has room for tuning. Targeted scaling and symmetry-driven triage likely boosted accuracy; further refinement for no-peer cases or dynamic thresholds may improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name targeted_router_scaling_and_confidence_tweak - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Invariant Network Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Pairwise link-symmetry hardening with a 2% tolerance and traffic-based status reconciliation, plus router-level flow-conservation scaling bounded to [0.5, 2.0] driven by average direction confidence and propagated to peers. Final confidences blend pair residuals (0.6), router imbalance (0.3), and status (0.1) with change penalties; down links are zeroed with adjusted confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.79 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.788, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.743.
- **Feedback**: Status correction is perfect, while counter fixes are strong but leave small residual imbalances; confidence scores are somewhat under-calibrated. Consider refining scaling decisions/thresholds and unpaired-interface handling to tighten counter repairs and improve confidence calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name router_symmetry_propagation_weighted_confidence - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair via Link and Flow Invariants**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair using link symmetry (2% tolerance) with status-aware zeroing and targeted substitution/averaging, followed by router-level flow conservation via directional scaling of RX or TX. Confidence blends post-repair residuals, router imbalance, and change penalties, with status consistency checks and enforced zeros on down interfaces.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 0.77 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.766, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.738).
- **Feedback**: Strong status accuracy stems from conservative down-link handling and peer-aligned corrections; overall repairs are consistent and passed all validation tests. Confidence is reasonable but could be tightened by refining the 2% threshold or scaling logic to further reduce residual imbalances and improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name triage_substitution_router_guard_postscale_conf - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Symmetry and Flow Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Pair-level hardening enforces link symmetry and status consistency using a 2% tolerance and traffic evidence, zeroing down links and averaging or selecting peer rates when mismatched. Router-level flow conservation scales the less-trusted direction per router within [0.5, 2.0], and confidences blend pair/router residuals and status with a change-penalty and idle-link adjustment.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.84; counter_repair_accuracy 0.852; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.763.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair and strong counter repair show the invariants are effective. Confidence calibration trails; consider tuning residual-to-confidence mapping and penalty weights to better align confidence with edit magnitude and router imbalance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name hodor_crossover_confidence_hardened - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Invariant Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Three-pass pipeline: link-level hardening with 2% tolerance and targeted substitution/averaging, router-level flow conservation scaling of RX/TX, and post-scaling pairwise reconciliation using a suspicion metric (link residuals, scaling magnitude, router imbalance). Confidence blends post-repair link residuals, router imbalance, and change penalties; statuses are preserved, zeroed when down, and inconsistencies lower status confidence.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.81 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.810; status_repair_accuracy 1.000; confidence_calibration 0.757).
- **Feedback**: Symmetry- and conservation-based adjustments yielded strong counter and perfect status repair, aided by conservative status handling. Confidence is reasonably calibrated but could be improved in noisy or peer-missing cases; treating unknown as up and a uniform 2% threshold may under/over-adjust in edge scenarios.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name pairwise_link_reconciliation - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence Calibration**
- **Implementation**: Enforces per-link symmetry with a 2% tolerance and reconciles interface status via pair agreement or traffic evidence, applying “down ⇒ zero” with confidence adjustments. Applies router-level flow conservation using topology with confidence-weighted, capacity-capped redistribution (≤35% per interface; scaling bounded 0.5–2.0), then recalibrates confidences from pair/router residuals and change penalties.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.86: counter_repair_accuracy 0.870, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.780.
- **Feedback**: Strong pair symmetry hardening and conservative router redistribution likely drove high counter repair and perfect status accuracy. Confidence calibration trailed, indicating mild over/under-confidence after larger edits or residual imbalances; tuning residual-to-confidence mapping or penalty weights could improve calibration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name weighted_router_redistribution - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Confidence-weighted, capacity-capped router redistribution pushed counter accuracy to the top tier.
  - Top performer: Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair with Confidence Calibration (Generation 14, weighted_router_redistribution) reached combined 0.86 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.870 using confidence-weighted, capacity-capped redistribution (≤35% per interface) and scaling bounded to [0.5, 2.0].
  - Similar but slightly lower: Symmetry and Flow Telemetry Repair (Generation 12, hodor_crossover_confidence_hardened) and Topology-Aware Telemetry Repair (Generation 4, post_repair_confidence_calibration_and_unpaired_down_enforcement) both at 0.84 with 0.852 counter accuracy used bounded scaling and residual-based confidence blending, but without the stronger per-interface weighting/caps seen in Gen14.
- Robust link-symmetry hardening with a 2% tolerance and traffic-evidence status reconciliation consistently delivered perfect status accuracy and stable counter repairs.
  - All top programs (Gen1/4/12/14) share: 2% pair tolerance, status evidence via traffic (>0.5 Mbps), and “down ⇒ zero” enforcement.
- Multi-component confidence calibration (pair residuals + router imbalance + change penalties) provided reasonable calibration while enabling aggressive but controlled repairs.
  - Gen14’s blend (pair 0.6, router 0.3, status 0.1) with change penalties achieved 0.780 calibration, better than other high-counter programs (Gen1/4/12 at 0.743–0.763), while maintaining superior counter accuracy.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Uniform per-router scaling (scale one direction uniformly across up interfaces) underperformed in counter repair.
  - Programs using simple “scale larger aggregate to match smaller” without per-interface weighting (e.g., Generation 2 link_and_router_hardening_with_confidence at 0.758 counter accuracy; Generations 5–7 at 0.756–0.756) lagged behind the weighted/capped approaches (≥0.852).
- Over-reliance on direct peer substitution/averaging when violating symmetry capped counter improvements.
  - Generations 5–7 and 11 used peer substitution/averaging with the 2% threshold and achieved only 0.756–0.766 counter accuracy despite perfect status, indicating over/under-correction in asymmetric/noisy cases.
- Treating unknown status as up and uniform thresholds reduced calibration robustness in edge scenarios.
  - Generation 13 (pairwise_link_reconciliation) feedback notes “treating unknown as up and a uniform 2% threshold may under/over-adjust in edge scenarios,” with confidence_calibration at 0.757 and combined 0.81 despite a three-pass pipeline.

## Implementation Insights
- The current best program’s effectiveness comes from combining bounded scaling with confidence-weighted redistribution and per-interface caps.
  - Gen14 uses bounded scaling [0.5, 2.0] and then additive redistribution that weights lower-confidence interfaces more, capped at ≤35% per interface over iterative passes. This directly correlates with the highest counter accuracy (0.870), outperforming routers scaled uniformly (≤0.810).
- Pairwise hardening choices matter: averaging within tolerance and selective substitution beyond tolerance stabilize symmetry without over-editing good data.
  - Gen14 and other top performers compute residuals with a ~2% tolerance, average when within tolerance, and substitute peer counterparts otherwise. This preserves high-confidence data and minimizes unnecessary edits, contributing to strong counter accuracy and stable calibration (~0.780).
- Confidence blending tied to post-repair residuals plus change penalties balances assertiveness and calibration.
  - Gen14’s confidence: weighted by pair residuals (0.6) and router imbalance (0.3), then penalized by relative edit magnitude. This improved calibration (0.780) over other high-counter programs (Gen1/4/12 at 0.743–0.763), indicating the penalty helps align confidence with edit size.
- Traffic-evidence status logic is a universal anchor for perfect status accuracy.
  - Across programs with 1.000 status accuracy (e.g., Gen1/4/12/14), the combination of status reconciliation via pair agreement/traffic evidence and strict “down ⇒ zero” enforcement is consistent and robust.

## Performance Analysis
- Incremental gains from flow conservation and redistribution strategies:
  - Baseline with no flow conservation (Generation 0 initial_program) achieved 0.83 combined (counter 0.826). Introducing router-level conservation with bounded scaling lifted combined scores to 0.84 (Generations 1/4/12) and ultimately to 0.86 in Gen14 with confidence-weighted, capacity-capped redistribution.
- Strong correlation between advanced router redistribution and counter repair gains:
  - Weighted/capped redistribution (Gen14) > bounded but more uniform scaling (Gen1/4/12) > uniform scaling of larger aggregate (Gen2/5/6/7/8/11) in counter accuracy: 0.870 > 0.852 > 0.756–0.810.
- Confidence calibration trades off with aggressiveness of counter repairs:
  - Highest calibration among mid-counter programs: Generation 2 at 0.829 (but counter 0.758). High-counter programs (Gen1/4/12) had 0.743–0.763 calibration; the best program (Gen14) improved calibration to 0.780 while still increasing counter accuracy, indicating better residual-to-confidence alignment and penalties.
- Status accuracy is saturated at 1.000 across most implementations:
  - Consistent use of traffic-evidence status reconciliation and down-link zeroing explains the uniform 1.000 status_repair_accuracy from Generation 0 through 14, making counter repair and confidence calibration the primary differentiators among top programs.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add a bounded multiplicative pre-step before additive redistribution. For the less-trusted direction at each router, apply a gentle scale toward s_bounded with a capped step, e.g., s_step = clamp(s, 0.85, 1.15) or use s_step = s_bounded**0.5, then recompute need and run the existing confidence-weighted, capacity-capped additive pass. This combines the proven strengths of bounded scaling and weighted redistribution (as in Gen14) and should reduce residuals faster while staying stable.

2. Make per-interface redistribution caps adaptive and ramped across passes. Start with MAX_ROUTER_ADJ_FRAC = 0.25 on pass 1, then 0.35 on pass 2, and allow up to 0.45 on pass 3 only for interfaces with low confidence (e.g., conf < 0.6) or tiny baselines (v < 5 Mbps); keep a per-router total delta cap at ~25% of the router’s traffic to prevent over-correction. This preserves stability on trusted interfaces while unlocking larger, targeted fixes where the data is unreliable.

3. Reconcile link symmetry after router redistribution with a limited correction pass. After the router-level adjustment, recompute pair residuals and if rel_diff > HARDENING_THRESHOLD, pull each endpoint toward its peer by up to 30% of the residual (or average if within tolerance), then update confidences with an additional change penalty. This guards against router edits drifting pairs apart and sustains the robust symmetry hardening that underpins high counter accuracy.

4. Use rate-aware tolerance and a smoother residual-to-confidence mapping. Replace the fixed 2% pair tolerance with tol_pair = max(0.02, 5.0 / max(traffic, 1.0)) so low-rate links are not over-edited, and update conf_from_residual to a logistic decay (e.g., conf = 1 / (1 + exp(k*(residual/tol - 1))) with k ≈ 3) plus an extra penalty when an interface hits its cap. This should improve confidence calibration (building on Gen14’s penalty gains) without sacrificing the counter repairs.

5. Enrich redistribution weights with pair residual and imbalance contribution. Set weight per interface to a convex combination, e.g., w = 0.5*(1 - conf_dir) + 0.3*pair_residual_dir + 0.2*(v / sum_v), and reduce w by 50% if the interface is already near zero to avoid pushing negative/idle links. This targets adjustments to the least reliable and most inconsistent edges, aligning with the evidence that confidence-weighted, targeted redistribution drives the top counter accuracy.
