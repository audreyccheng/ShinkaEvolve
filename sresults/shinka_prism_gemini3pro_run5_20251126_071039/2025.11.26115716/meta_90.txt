# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 80-89, the Current Best Program, and previous global insights, here are the actionable optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **First-Improvement Bottleneck Descent**: The **Current Best Program** (0.006s) and **Gen 89** (0.010s) outperform others by using a "First-Improvement" strategy specifically targeting the bottleneck GPU. Unlike **Gen 86** (0.031s), which used "Steepest Descent" to find the absolute best move, the top programs immediately commit to the first move or swap that reduces the peak pressure, allowing for significantly more iterations within the same timeframe.
- **Linearized Binary Search Initialization**: A consistent pattern among all top performers (Generations 80, 81, 83, 85-89) is transforming the non-linear pressure constraint ($R/S \le K$) into a linear bin-packing constraint ($R + K \cdot S \le K \cdot C$). This allows standard heuristics like Best-Fit Decreasing (BFD) to generate high-quality initial solutions that are very close to the global optimum.
- **Atomic Random Kicks**: The **Current Best Program** utilizes a simple "patience-based" mechanism that triggers a single random move after a short period of stagnation. This approach is far superior to the complex "Ruin and Recreate" or "Adaptive Perturbation" strategies used in **Gen 83** (0.055s) and **Gen 88** (0.155s), which incurred high latency without improving the score.
- **Bottleneck-Only Search Space**: The most effective local search algorithms explicitly restrict their evaluation to moves originating from the single GPU with the highest pressure (`src`). This reduces the search complexity from checking all GPU pairs ($O(N^2)$) to only checking the bottleneck against others ($O(N)$), as seen in the **Current Best Program**.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Complex Perturbation Logic**: **Gen 88** ("Adaptive Ruin & Recreate") and **Gen 83** ("Analytical Iterated Local Search") employed sophisticated perturbation phases involving variance smoothing or batch re-optimization. These methods drastically increased execution time (up to 0.155s vs 0.006s) and, in the case of **Gen 88** (Score 26.22), actually degraded solution quality compared to the simpler random kicks (Score 26.26).
- **Dual Initialization Strategies**: **Gen 84** attempted to combine Binary Search with a Greedy MinMax initialization. Despite being conceptually robust, this program achieved a lower score (26.23) than pure Binary Search variants (26.26). The overhead of computing multiple initializations and the potential for the Greedy heuristic to seed the search in a harder-to-escape local optimum proved counterproductive.
- **Direct Object Hashing**: **Gen 82** crashed (Score 0.00) because it attempted to use Model objects as dictionary keys during the perturbation phase. Algorithms must rely on list indices or immutable metadata wrappers rather than raw mutable objects for state tracking.

## Implementation Insights
- **Incremental State Management**: The **Current Best Program** achieves its sub-10ms runtime by maintaining flat arrays for GPU state (`gpu_s` for size, `gpu_w` for workload) and updating them in-place (`+=`, `-=`). This avoids the $O(M)$ cost of summing model attributes during every move evaluation, which is critical when performing thousands of checks.
- **Virtual Size Heuristic**: The **Current Best Program** and **Gen 89** implement a specific feasibility check where items are sorted by "virtual size" ($Virtual = Workload + K \cdot Size$). This heuristic aligns the packing order with the pressure constraint more effectively than sorting by raw size or workload alone, facilitating the tight

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the Current Best Program and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Best-Fit Decreasing (BFD) in Packing**
    Replace the current "First-Fit" logic in the `_pack` function with a "Best-Fit" strategy. When placing an item, iterate through all valid GPUs and select the one with the *minimum sufficient remaining capacity* (both physical and virtual). This reduces memory fragmentation during the binary search initialization, allowing the algorithm to validate tighter lower bounds ($K$) than First-Fit.

2.  **Bottleneck-Targeted Perturbation (Smart Kick)**
    Modify the random kick mechanism to explicitly target the current bottleneck GPU. Instead of selecting a random source GPU (`s_rnd`), force the source to be the GPU with the highest pressure (`src`) and try to move or swap a random item from it to a GPU with high slack. This ensures that every perturbation attempts to break the specific deadlock causing stagnation, rather than shuffling non-critical GPUs.

3.  **Workload-Based Sorting Heuristic**
    Add a third sorting strategy to `_check_feasibility_multi` that sorts items solely by their workload (`req_rate / slo`) in descending order. While the current "Virtual Size" and "Physical Size" heuristics cover mixed and memory-bound cases, some constraint landscapes are purely workload-bound; sorting by workload ensures these high-pressure, low-memory items are packed efficiently into the available capacity.

4.  **Priority Sorting for Move Candidates**
    In the local search phase, before iterating through the items on the bottleneck GPU (`models = placement[src]`), sort them by their pressure contribution (`w`) in descending order. Attempting to move or swap the highest-impact items first aligns with a "Steepest Descent" philosophy while maintaining the speed of "First-Improvement," potentially resolving the bottleneck in fewer iterations.

5.  **Slack-Based Search Pruning**
    Optimize the inner loops of the local search by skipping destination GPUs (`dst`) that are already under high pressure. Add a check (e.g., `if gpu_w[dst] / remaining_mem > current_max_k * 0.95`) to bypass calculations for GPUs that are unlikely to accept new items without becoming new bottlenecks themselves. This reduces the search space $O(N)$ constant factors, yielding more total iterations within the time limit.
