# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the detailed analysis of Generations 30-39 and the code for the Current Best Program (Generation 38), here are the actionable optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Dual-Key Binary Search Initialization**: The most robust programs (Gen 38, Gen 36-39) utilize a binary search feasibility check that attempts packing using two distinct sorting keys: "Virtual Size" ($load + K \times size$) and a fallback to "Physical Size" ($size$). This multi-heuristic approach creates a tighter, high-quality starting configuration compared to single-heuristic methods.
- **Bottleneck-Focused Descent with Random Kicks**: The programs achieving the top score of **26.26** (Gen 33, 37, 38) employ a specific "Iterated Local Search" pattern. They deterministically optimize the single bottleneck GPU (`src`) until progress stalls, then immediately apply a random "Kick" (moving a random model between arbitrary GPUs) to escape the local optimum at 26.23.
- **Strict Minimax Acceptance**: Unlike approaches attempting to smooth variance, the Current Best Program (Gen 38) uses a strict acceptance criterion: `max(nk_src, nk_dst) < max_k - 1e-6`. Moves are only accepted if they strictly reduce the global maximum pressure, focusing computational effort entirely on the min-max objective.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Pure Deterministic LNS/ILS**: Programs like Gen 30 and Gen 32 stalled at a score of **26.23**. Gen 32's "Best-Improvement" strategy, which exhaustively scans for the best local move, proved computationally slower (0.045s vs 0.006s) and less effective at escaping local optima than the "First-Improvement with Random Kicks" strategy.
- **Heavy Ruin-Recreate Overhead**: While Gen 35 achieved the top score of 26.26, its execution time was **0.141s**, orders of magnitude slower than Gen 38 (0.006s). This indicates that complex ruin-and-recreate strategies (dismantling large parts of the solution) are unnecessary overhead compared to simple atomic "Kicks" for this problem scale.
- **Greedy Variance Reduction**: Solely relying on variance reduction (without stochastic perturbations) proved insufficient to bridge the gap from 26.23 to 26.26. While variance is a good proxy, the direct attack on the peak value combined with random jumps is more effective.

## Implementation Insights
- **Virtual Size Linearization**: The Current Best Program (Gen 38) implements a critical sort key in `_check_feasibility_multi`: `pack_items.sort(key=lambda x: x['w'] + K * x['s'])`. This linear combination of load ($w$) and size ($s$), scaled by the target ratio $K$, effectively transforms the 2D vector packing problem into a 1D scalar problem solvable by fast First-Fit algorithms.
- **Patience-Based State Machine**: A key implementation detail in Gen 38 is the `patience` counter (set to 30). The algorithm switches from deterministic "Descent" to stochastic "Kick" only after 30 consecutive failed attempts to improve the bottleneck. This precise balance between exploitation and exploration is central to its speed.
- **Incremental State Updates**: To achieve 0.006s execution time, the best code updates state arrays (`gpu_s`, `gpu_w`) incrementally (`+=`, `-=`) during swaps, avoiding expensive re-summation of lists inside the inner optimization loop.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 26.23 vs. 26.26 Cliff**: There is a hard performance wall at 26.23 for algorithms lacking sufficient stochasticity (Gen 30, 32). The leap to 26.26 is consistently achieved by introducing randomized "Kicks" or perturbations (Gen 31, 33-39).

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the successful "Binary Search Packing + Iterated Local Search" pattern in Generation 38 (Score: 26.26), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Upgrade to Best-Fit Decreasing (BFD) Packing**: The current `_pack` function utilizes First-Fit, which places models in the first valid GPU, often fragmenting capacity. Modify `_pack` to implement **Best-Fit Decreasing**, which scans all valid GPUs and places the current model into the one with the *minimum sufficient residual virtual capacity*. This tighter packing minimizes waste and can validate lower target KVPRs during the binary search initialization.
2.  **Implement Variance-Based Tie-Breaking**: The current local search strictly rejects moves unless they lower the global maximum (`max_k`). Modify the acceptance criteria to handle **ties** (where `new_max_k == current_max_k`) by accepting configurations that lower the **sum of squared pressures** (variance). This allows the algorithm to traverse plateaus and "smooth" the load distribution on non-bottleneck GPUs, creating the slack needed for future peak reductions.
3.  **Intensify Perturbation with "Burst Kicks"**: The current single-item random kick is effective but often insufficient to escape deep local optima (specifically the 26.23 barrier). Replace it with a **Burst Kick** strategy that performs a sequence of 3-5 random moves or swaps (ignoring objective function improvement) before restarting the optimization phase. This larger state-space jump prevents the greedy descent from immediately reversing the perturbation.
4.  **Add Intensity-Density Sorting Heuristic**: Expand the `_check_feasibility_multi` function to include a third sorting key: **Intensity Density** (`(req_rate/slo) / model_size`). While the current "Virtual Size" heuristic balances constraints, sorting by density ensures that small, high-intensity models are packed early, preventing them from becoming difficult "outliers" that fail the packing in later stages when fragmentation is high.
5.  **Apply Heuristic-Guided Candidate Ordering**: Currently, the local search iterates through items on the bottleneck GPU in an arbitrary list order. Optimize the descent by **sorting the bottleneck items** by their pressure contribution (e.g., descending $w$) before attempting moves or swaps. This "Guided First-Improvement" strategy focuses computational resources on relocating the most problematic items first, accelerating convergence without the overhead of a full "Best-Improvement" search.
