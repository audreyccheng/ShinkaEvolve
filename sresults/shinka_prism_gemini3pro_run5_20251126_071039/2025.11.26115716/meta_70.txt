# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 60-69, the Current Best Program (Generation 38), and previous global insights, here are the actionable optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **First-Improvement vs. Steepest Descent**: The **Current Best Program** (0.006s) utilizes a "First-Improvement" strategy where it immediately accepts the first move or swap that reduces the bottleneck pressure. In contrast, Generation 64 achieved the same high score (26.26) but was 3x slower (0.018s) using a "Steepest Descent" approach that evaluates all possible moves before selecting the best one.
- **Multi-Heuristic Binary Search Initialization**: The dominant pattern for 100% success rates and high scores (26.26) remains the initialization via binary search over the pressure bound $K$. Successful variants (Gen 60, 62-66, 68-69) and the **Current Best Program** all employ this, often alternating between "Virtual Size" ($w + K \cdot s$) and "Physical Size" ($s$) sorting keys to maximize feasibility.
- **Atomic Stochastic Kicks**: The most efficient mechanism for escaping local optima—achieving the 26.26 score floor with minimal latency—is the simple atomic perturbation used by the **Current Best Program**. It attempts to move a single random item when patience is exhausted. This is significantly faster than "Burst Kicks" (Gen 60, 64) or "Ruin and Recreate" (Gen 66), which involve heavier batch modifications.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Lexicographical Optimization**: Generation 61 utilized a "Lexicographical Descent" local search, which optimizes the entire vector of pressures rather than just the peak. It stalled at a score of **26.25**, slightly below the optimal 26.26 found by Minimax approaches. This suggests that broadly optimizing the distribution can dilute the aggressive focus required to crush the specific bottleneck GPU.
- **Complex Perturbation Logic**: Programs using Large Neighborhood Search (Gen 63, 68) or structured "Ruin and Recreate" (Gen 66) achieved the target score of 26.26 but incurred massive execution time penalties (0.059s - 0.121s) compared to the Best Program (0.006s). The overhead of reconstructing partial solutions offers no score advantage over simple random moves in this problem space.
- **Variance Smoothing Overhead**: While Gen 62 and 65 successfully reached the top score (26.26), their use of variance reduction as a secondary objective or tie-breaker increased execution time to ~0.060s-0.100s. The direct reduction of peak pressure (as seen in the Best Program) converges faster than smoothing the load distribution.

## Implementation Insights
- **Incremental State Arrays**: The **Current Best Program** achieves superior speed by maintaining simple arrays for GPU state (`gpu_s` for size, `gpu_w` for workload) and updating them incrementally (`+=`, `-=`) during moves. This O(1) update cost stands in contrast to slower implementations that likely recalculate sums or reconstruct objects during the local search loop.
- **Constraint Linearization**: A key efficiency detail in the **Current Best Program** is transforming the non-linear pressure ratio objective into a linear bin-packing constraint: `key=lambda x: x['w'] + K * x['s']`. This enables the use of fast, standard sorting heuristics (FFD) during the binary search phase.
- **Patience-Based Triggering**: The **Current Best Program** uses a simple integer counter (`no_improve > patience`) to trigger perturbations. This is computationally cheaper and just as effective as the more complex "plateau detection" or "variance analysis" used in slower generations (Gen 60, 62).

## Performance Analysis
- **Speed-Complexity Hierarchy**: There is a clear stratification in execution times among programs achieving the top score (26.26):
    - **~0.006s (Best)**: First-Improvement Descent + Atomic Kicks.
    - **~0.018s (Gen 64)**: Steepest Descent + Burst Kicks.
    - **~0.050s+ (Gen 60, 65, 66)**: Variance Smoothing or Ruin-Recreate.
    - **~0.100s+ (Gen 63, 68)**: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS).
- **The 26.26 Convergence**: With 8 out of 9 valid programs in this batch achieving exactly 26.26, the algorithmic ceiling for this dataset appears to have been reached. The primary differentiator is now strictly computational efficiency.
- **Score Sensitivity**: The deviation of Gen 61 (26.25) confirms that the objective function logic (Minimax vs. Lexicographical) is the only factor influencing the final score, whereas the search strategy (LNS vs. Greedy vs. Steepest) only impacts the execution time.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the Current Best Program (Generation 38) and the global insights from Generations 60-69, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Best-Fit Decreasing (BFD) in Initialization**
    The current `_pack` function utilizes a First-Fit strategy, placing items in the first GPU that accommodates them. Change this to **Best-Fit Decreasing**, which selects the GPU with the *minimum sufficient remaining capacity* for each item. This reduces memory fragmentation during the binary search phase, potentially validating lower $K$ bounds (tighter pressures) before the local search even begins.

2.  **Sort Bottleneck Items for "Ordered First-Improvement"**
    The current local search iterates through items on the bottleneck GPU in an arbitrary list order. Optimize this by **sorting the bottleneck items by descending workload ($w$)** at the start of the greedy descent loop. This focuses the "First-Improvement" strategy on the most problematic items first, approximating the quality of "Steepest Descent" without incurring the computational penalty of evaluating every possible move.

3.  **Incorporate Density-Based Sorting in Feasibility Checks**
    The `_check_feasibility_multi` function currently uses "Virtual Size" and "Physical Size" heuristics. Add a third heuristic that sorts items by **Pressure Density ($w / s$)**. This addresses edge cases where items are small in size but high in computational demand, preventing the binary search from stalling on specific "hot" item combinations and improving the robustness of the initial solution.

4.  **Enable Secondary Objective for Plateau Traversal**
    The current acceptance criteria strictly requires a reduction in the global peak (`max_k`). Modify the logic to accept moves where the new peak is **equal** to the current peak if a secondary metric—specifically the **sum of workloads** or **pressure variance**—is reduced. This allows the algorithm to reorganize the layout during plateau phases, creating the necessary slack for subsequent peak reductions without relying solely on random kicks.

5.  **Adopt Adaptive "Burst" Perturbations**
    While the single atomic kick is fast, it may fail to escape deep local optima. Implement an **adaptive perturbation strategy**: start with the current single-item random move, but if improvement stalls for multiple consecutive kick cycles, trigger a "Burst" of 3-5 random moves. This maintains the speed of the atomic approach for shallow optima while providing the escape velocity of larger perturbations when necessary.
