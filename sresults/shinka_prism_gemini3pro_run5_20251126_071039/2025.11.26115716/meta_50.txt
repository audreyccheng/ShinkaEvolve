# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 40-49 and the Current Best Program (Generation 38), here are the actionable optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Multi-Strategy Binary Search Initialization**: The most effective programs (Current Best, Gen 40, Gen 43) utilize a binary search over the pressure bound $K$ that checks feasibility using multiple sorting keys: "Virtual Size" ($w + K \cdot s$) and "Physical Size" ($s$). This creates a high-quality initial configuration that is often near-optimal.
- **Bottleneck-Targeted Iterated Local Search (ILS)**: Programs achieving the top score of **26.26** with the lowest latency (Current Best: 0.006s, Gen 46: 0.011s) exclusively focus their deterministic optimization steps (moves/swaps) on the single GPU with the highest pressure (`src`), rather than scanning the entire cluster.
- **Patience-Based Stochastic Kicks**: To break the 26.23 score barrier, successful algorithms (Current Best, Gen 40-43, 45-49) implement a "Kick" or perturbation phase. The optimal pattern tracks a `patience` counter; if the bottleneck cannot be improved after $N$ attempts (e.g., 30), it forces a random move to escape the local optimum.
- **Lexicographical Optimization**: Gen 43 achieved the perfect 26.26 score by optimizing the lexicographical order of the pressure vector. This confirms that strictly minimizing the sorted vector of pressures is a robust alternative to minimizing just the peak, though the "Bottleneck + Kick" approach remains faster.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Primary Variance Reduction**: Gen 44 focused on "VNS and Variance-Based Refinement" and was the only program in this batch to stall at a score of **26.23**. While variance reduction smooths the load, it is less effective than direct Minimax optimization with random kicks for reducing the specific bottleneck peak in this problem instance.
- **Complex "Smart" Perturbations**: While Gen 42 and Gen 49 achieved the top score of 26.26, their execution times (0.075s and 0.053s) were significantly slower than the Current Best (0.006s). Elaborate logic to select perturbation targets or "repack specific GPUs" introduces unnecessary overhead compared to simple random atomic moves.
- **Full Ruin-and-Recreate**: Approaches involving heavy destruction and rebuilding of partial solutions (seen in previous generations and implicit in slower LNS variants like Gen 48 at 0.044s) are computationally expensive and do not yield better scores than fast, targeted swaps.

## Implementation Insights
- **Virtual Size Linearization**: The Current Best Program and Gen 45 rely on a critical transformation: `pack_items.sort(key=lambda x: x['w'] + K * x['s'])`. This linear combination allows standard First-Fit Decreasing algorithms to solve the 2D packing problem (rate + memory) efficiently during the binary search phase.
- **Incremental State Maintenance**: The Current Best Program achieves 0.006s execution time by updating state variables (`gpu_s`, `gpu_w`) incrementally (`+=`, `-=`) within the inner loop. Programs that re-sum lists or calculate variance over the whole cluster in every step (Gen 42, 49) suffer 5-10x latency penalties.
- **State Machine Control Flow**: The Best Program uses a simple state machine: strictly greedy descent on the bottleneck -> if `no_improve > patience` -> random kick. This explicit mode switching prevents the algorithm from wasting cycles on unproductive greedy moves or premature randomization.

## Performance Analysis
- **Speed vs. Complexity**: There is a clear correlation between simplicity and speed among the top scorers. The Current Best Program (0.006s) and Gen 46 (0.011s) use simple bottleneck-focused logic. In contrast, programs with "Smart Perturbation" (Gen 42, 0.075s) or "Randomized Packing" overhead (Gen 49, 0.053s) are an order of magnitude slower despite achieving the same score.
- **The 26.23 vs 26.26 Cliff**: The threshold remains distinct. Algorithms lacking a mechanism to accept temporary degradation (via random kicks) or strictly minimizing variance (Gen 44) cap at 26.23. The 26.26 score is consistently unlocked by introducing controlled stochasticity.
- **Convergence Consistency**: The high success rate (100%) across Gen 40-49 indicates that the binary search initialization provides a very robust feasible region, and the subsequent optimization is primarily refining the optimality gap (KVPR) rather than finding feasibility.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the successful strategies in Generation 38 and the insights from Generations 40-49, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Switch to Best-Fit Decreasing (BFD) Packing**: Modify the `_pack` function to implement Best-Fit Decreasing instead of the current First-Fit approach. By placing models into the GPU with the minimum sufficient residual virtual capacity, BFD reduces memory fragmentation. This allows the binary search initialization to validate tighter lower bounds for $K$, providing a higher-quality starting solution for the local search.
2.  **Implement Secondary Objective Tie-Breaking**: Enhance the move acceptance logic in the local search to handle plateau traversal. Currently, the algorithm only accepts strictly better peaks. Modify the condition to accept moves where the new peak is **equal** to the current peak if a secondary metric—such as the **sum of squared pressures** (variance) or total pressure—is reduced. This smooths the load on non-bottleneck GPUs, creating necessary slack for subsequent peak reductions.
3.  **Adopt Multi-Step "Burst" Kicks**: Replace the single-item random kick with a **Burst Kick** strategy that performs a sequence of 3-5 random moves or swaps when `patience` is exhausted. Insights show that single perturbations are often immediately reversed by the greedy descent; a larger, blind jump in the state space helps escape deep local optima (specifically the 26.23 score barrier) without the computational overhead of "smart" perturbation logic.
4.  **Heuristic-Guided Descent Ordering**: Optimize the local search inner loop by sorting the items on the bottleneck GPU before attempting moves. Instead of iterating in arbitrary list order, sort items by **descending pressure contribution** ($w$) or size ($s$). This "Guided First-Improvement" ensures the algorithm prioritizes relocating the most problematic items first, accelerating convergence towards the optimal 26.26 score.
5.  **Expand Initialization with Density Sorting**: Add a third sorting heuristic to the `_check_feasibility_multi` function based on **Intensity Density** (Request Rate / Model Size). While "Virtual Size" works well generally, sorting by density ensures that small, high-intensity models are packed early. This diversity in initialization increases the likelihood that the binary search lands in a feasible region closer to the global optimum, reducing the work required by the local search.
