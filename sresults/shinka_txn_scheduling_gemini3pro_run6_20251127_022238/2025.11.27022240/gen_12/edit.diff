-    Get optimal schedule using Adaptive Greedy Construction followed by Hybrid Local Search.
-    
-    Strategy:
-    1. Generate 'num_seqs' candidate schedules using a randomized greedy approach that 
-       switches to exhaustive search near the end of the sequence.
-    2. Pick the best candidate.
-    3. Refine it using a local search with both Swap and Shift operators.
+    Get optimal schedule using Weighted Probabilistic Greedy Construction and Biased Local Search.
+    
+    Method:
+    1. Construction Phase: Builds multiple candidate schedules.
+       - Selection uses weighted probability (weights = txn duration) to favor LPT (Longest Processing Time) items.
+       - Includes pure random candidates for diversity.
+       - Switches to exhaustive search at the tail (last 20 items) to perfect the schedule's end.
+       - Tie-breaking: Amongst candidates yielding equal minimal makespan, pick the longest duration transaction.
+    2. Local Search Phase:
+       - Starts from the best constructed schedule.
+       - Uses Shift (Insert) operator heavily (80%) as it is more effective for sequencing.
+       - Uses Swap operator (20%) for perturbation.
