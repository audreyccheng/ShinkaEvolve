Based on the analysis of Generations 71-80 and the Current Best Program (Generation 69/60

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 69) and the successful trends identified in previous generations, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations. These recommendations focus on intensifying the heuristic biases that have proven effective and introducing controlled stochasticity to escape local optima.

1.  **Quartic ($d^4$) Probability Weighting**
    The current program uses Cubic ($d^3$) weighting for random sampling, which successfully prioritizes heavy transactions. Increase this exponent to **Quartic ($d^4$)** (`weights = [d**4 for d in pool]`). This steeper probability curve will nearly eliminate the selection of low-cost items in early beam search phases, strictly enforcing a "heavy-items-first" packing strategy while retaining just enough randomness to break ties among top candidates.

2.  **Threshold-Based ILS Acceptance**
    The current Iterated Local Search (ILS) uses a strictly greedy acceptance criterion (`if p_cost < curr_cost`), which limits exploration. Implement a **Threshold Acceptance** mechanism that accepts a perturbed schedule if its cost is within a small margin (e.g., 0.5% to 1%) of the current cost (`p_cost < curr_cost * 1.005`). This relaxation allows the algorithm to traverse "valleys" in the fitness landscape to find better global optima.

3.  **Aggressive Ruin Set Sizing (6-9 Items)**
    The current "Ruin" perturbation removes only 3-5 items, which is often insufficient to disrupt complex dependency knots in dense schedules. Increase the ruin set size to **6-9 transactions**. Removing a larger chunk of the schedule forces the "Greedy Best-Fit" repair logic to reconstruct more significant segments of the timeline, potentially finding much tighter packing arrangements.

4.  **Top-4 Lookahead Target Set**
    The current multi-target lookahead evaluates the Top-3 remaining LPT transactions, which has proven effective. Incrementally expand this to evaluate the **Top-4 remaining LPT transactions**. This slight expansion provides better visibility into near-term bottlenecks and resource contention without incurring the prohibitive computational cost of significantly deeper or wider lookaheads.

5.  **Increased Deterministic Anchor Count**
    The current beam search preserves the top 2 LPT candidates deterministically to prevent "bad luck" from discarding the theoretical best moves. Increase this anchor count to **4 candidates**. By guaranteeing that a larger portion of the beam follows the critical path heuristic, you stabilize the search trajectory, allowing the remaining stochastic samples to focus purely on finding high-risk/high-reward shortcuts without risking the baseline performance.
