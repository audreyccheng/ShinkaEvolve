# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the provided program summaries and the code of the current best program (Generation 33), here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Selective 1-Step Lookahead:** The top-performing programs, led by **Gen 33** (Score 3.77) and **Gen 38** (Score 3.76), implement a specific "LPT Lookahead" strategy. Instead of a deep search, they tentatively schedule the next largest available transaction (LPT) to the current candidate. This acts as a "sanity check" to ensure that the current move does not disproportionately block critical future work, providing a high return on investment compared to deeper, more expensive lookaheads.
- **Perturb-and-Repair Iterated Local Search (ILS):** The **Current Best Program (Gen 33)** significantly improved upon previous local search strategies by wrapping the refinement in an ILS framework. It performs an initial descent (using both swaps and insertions), applies a random perturbation (swapping two random transactions), and then runs a second descent repair phase. This structure allows the algorithm to escape local optima that trapped previous generations.
- **Two-Stage Candidate Filtering:** **Gen 33** employs a hierarchical selection process that maximizes efficiency. It first generates a large pool of candidates and scores them with the cheap "Work Density" heuristic. It then filters for the top $2 \times BeamWidth$ unique candidates to undergo the expensive lookahead evaluation. This ensures computational resources are focused only on the most promising partial schedules.
- **Weighted/Squared Stochastic Sampling:** While top programs anchor the beam with deterministic LPT moves, the stochastic component has evolved. **Gen 33** uses weights based on transaction duration ($d$), and **Gen 39** (Score 3.73) successfully used squared weights ($d^2$). This biases the random exploration toward heavier items, complementing the deterministic anchors better than uniform random sampling.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Deep or Complex Lookahead:** Programs attempting 2-step lookaheads (**Gen 34**, Score 3.42; **Gen 37**, Score 3.32) or "Pilot" simulations (**Gen 40**, Score 3.24) consistently underperformed compared to the 1-step approach. The exponential cost of deeper lookahead likely forced reductions in beam width or search depth, preventing the algorithm from maintaining enough global diversity.
- **Static Conflict Metrics:** Approaches relying on pre-computed "conflict degrees" or volumes (**Gen 30**, Score 3.39; **Gen 32**, Score 3.24) failed to match the performance of the dynamic "Work Density" heuristic. Static metrics do not adapt to the changing availability of slots as the schedule fills, leading to suboptimal packing decisions.
- **Tapered Beam Width:** Reaffirming previous insights, **Gen 30** utilized a tapered beam search and achieved a relatively low score (3.39). Reducing the beam width over time prematurely prunes the search space, discarding paths that might resolve into efficient schedules later in the process.

## Implementation Insights
- **Lookahead "Sanity Check" Logic:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 33)** implements lookahead not as a full search, but as a scoring modifier.
    ```python
    # Tentatively add the next largest available transaction
    for cand in lookahead_pool:
        # ... find next_t ...
        la_score = (cand['cost'] + next_cost) - (cand['total_dur'] + next_dur)
    ```
    This specifically penalizes candidates that leave "holes" too small for the remaining large rocks, without the overhead of a full tree search.
- **Hybrid Descent Windows:** **Gen 33**'s local search function explicitly chains two different neighborhoods: a Windowed Swap (`w=5`) followed by a Windowed Insertion (`w=8`). The implementation finds that swaps are good for local ordering, while wider insertions are necessary to fix structural placement issues, confirming the value of mixing neighborhood types.
- **State Deduplication Before Lookahead:** A critical optimization in **Gen 33** is placing the deduplication logic (`seen_states.add(frozenset(new_rem))`) *before* the expensive lookahead step. This prevents the algorithm from wasting cycles simulating future costs for permutationally equivalent states, effectively doubling the diversity of the lookahead pool.

## Performance Analysis
- **Lookahead vs. Deep Lookahead:** There is a distinct performance gap between 1-step lookahead approaches (Scores **3.73 - 3.77** in Gen 33, 36, 38) and 2-step/Deep approaches (Scores **3.24 - 3.42** in Gen 34, 37, 40). The data suggests that the marginal gain of predicting two steps ahead is negative due to the computational trade-off.
- **Impact of ILS:** The jump from **Gen 31** (Score 3.72, no explicit lookahead but strong LS) to **Gen 33** (Score 3.77) demonstrates that while heuristics are important, the "Perturb and Repair" mechanism provides the final edge needed to maximize the score, likely by resolving 1-2 critical bottlenecks per workload.
- **Consistency of Density Heuristic:** Every program scoring above 3.70 (**Gen 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39**) utilized the `Cost - TotalDuration` density metric as its primary driver. Programs deviating to conflict-based metrics consistently dropped to the 3.20-3.40 range.
