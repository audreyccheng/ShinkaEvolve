# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the new program evaluations and the current best program (Generation 24), here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Work-Density Heuristic**: The top-performing programs, **Gen 24** (Score 3.66) and **Gen 20** (Score 3.57), utilized a specific priority heuristic: `(Cost - TotalDuration)`. This metric acts as a proxy for parallelism by rewarding schedules where the makespan grows significantly slower than the sum of added transaction durations, effectively targeting "free" slots in the schedule.
- **Two-Phase Local Refinement**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 24)** distinguished itself by employing a granular, two-stage post-processing strategy: Phase 1 performs **Windowed Swaps** (checking neighbors within a window of 5) to fix ordering, and Phase 2 performs **Targeted Insertions** (moving items within a small range) to resolve bottlenecks. This combination proved more effective than Swaps alone (used in previous generations like Gen 18).
- **Hybrid Anchored Sampling**: **Gen 24** and **Gen 25** (Score 3.61) solidified the efficacy of "anchoring" the search. They explicitly select the top 3 Longest Processing Time (LPT) transactions deterministically before filling the rest of the beam with random samples. This ensures critical path items are handled immediately while maintaining stochastic exploration.
- **State Deduplication**: Consistent across all top performers (**Gen 20, 21, 24, 25**), the use of set-based deduplication (`frozenset(rem_list)`) prevents the beam from collapsing into redundant permutations, maximizing the effective search width.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Tapered Beam Search**: Programs that reduced the beam width over time (**Gen 22, 23, 27, 28**) consistently scored in the lower tier (3.12 - 3.27). Unlike fixed-width beam search with deduplication, tapering appears to aggressively prune the search space too early, discarding paths that require depth to resolve effectively.
- **Ends-Out Sampling (LPT/SPT Mixing)**: While intuitive, explicitly mixing Longest and Shortest tasks (**Gen 17, 21**) scored lower (3.38 - 3.44) than the Hybrid LPT/Random approach used in **Gen 24** (3.66). Forcing the inclusion of shortest tasks early often fills gaps that should be reserved for medium-sized dependencies, whereas random sampling offers better flexibility.
- **Complex Conflict Heuristics**: Approaches relying heavily on pre-computed conflict weights (**Gen 23, 26, 27, 29**) achieved scores between 3.26 and 3.37. While decent, they failed to outperform the simpler, dynamic "Work Density" heuristic (3.66). The static conflict analysis does not adapt as well to the changing state of the partial schedule as the dynamic density metric does.

## Implementation Insights
- **Parallelism Proxy Tuple**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 24)** implements the work density heuristic using a Python tuple sort key: `key=lambda x: (x['cost'] - x['total_dur'], -x['total_dur'])`. This concise implementation prioritizes packing efficiency primarily, using total duration as a secondary tie-breaker to favor processing more work when packing efficiency is equal.
- **Localized Search Windows**: To enable aggressive refinement without performance penalties, **Gen 24** restricts local search operations to constant windows (`WINDOW = 5` for swaps, `+/- 4` for insertions). This O(N*K) complexity allows for multiple passes of refinement, which is far more valuable than a single exhaustive O(N^2) pass.
- **Deterministic vs. Stochastic Split**: A key coding pattern in the best program is the explicit split in candidate generation:
    ```python
    # 1. Deterministic LPT (Top 3)
    # ... code to add top 3 items ...
    # 2. Random Sampling
    # ... code to fill remainder with random.sample ...
    ```
    This guarantees that the algorithm *always* considers the greedy LPT move while exploring random deviations, preventing "unlucky" runs where the obvious best move is missed.

## Performance Analysis
- **Impact of Heuristic Choice**: There is a clear performance hierarchy based on the construction heuristic. "Work Density" based programs (**Gen 20, 24**) lead with scores >3.55, followed by "Deduplicated LPT/Random" (**Gen 15, 21, 25**) in the 3.40-3.60 range, and finally "Conflict/Tapered" approaches (**Gen 22, 23, 27**) lagging in the 3.10-3.30 range.
- **Refinement Compounding**: The jump from **Gen 20** (3.57) to **Gen 24** (3.66) highlights the value of the secondary refinement phase (Insertions). While both used similar construction heuristics, the addition of targeted insertions in Gen 24 resolved local optima that swap-based refinement missed.
- **Deduplication vs. Tapering**: Comparing **Gen 21** (Deduplicated, 3.38) with **Gen 22** (Tapered, 3.12) confirms that maintaining a full, diverse beam (via deduplication) is computationally more efficient for score maximization than reducing the beam size to save cycles. The structural diversity preserved by deduplication is critical for this problem class.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the top-performing Generation 24 and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Stochastic One-Step Lookahead**
    The current greedy expansion evaluates candidates solely on the immediate `(Cost - TotalDuration)`. You should implement a **shallow lookahead** where, for the top $N$ candidates, you tentatively add the next best available LPT transaction and evaluate the *resulting* combined state. This helps the algorithm detect "traps" where a locally optimal move (small duration) blocks a critical large transaction in the immediate future, resolving the horizon effect inherent in greedy beam search.

2.  **Iterated Local Search with Perturbation**
    Gen 24 successfully uses a two-phase refinement (Swaps and Insertions) but stops once local convergence is reached. You should upgrade this to an **Iterated Local Search (ILS)**: when the refinement phases stabilize, apply a "kick" by randomly shuffling a small subsequence (e.g., 4-6 transactions) or swapping two distant transactions, then re-run the refinement loop. This "perturbation and repair" cycle allows the schedule to escape the local optima that deterministic refinement often settles into.

3.  **Weighted Probabilistic Sampling**
    The current approach fills the beam with `random.sample` (uniform probability) after selecting the top 3 LPT tasks. You should replace this with **Weighted Random Sampling** (e.g., `random.choices` with weights), prioritizing transactions based on Duration or Conflict Degree. This "Soft LPT" approach maintains the necessary stochastic diversity to prevent beam collapse while biasing the search towards structurally significant tasks, rather than wasting cycles on trivial, low-impact transactions.

4.  **
