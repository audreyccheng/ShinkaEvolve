# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the new program evaluations (Generations 41-50) and the code of the new best program (Generation 48), here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Squared-Weighted Stochastic Sampling:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 48, Score 3.89)** introduced a non-linear sampling strategy where selection probability is proportional to the *square* of the transaction duration ($d^2$). This aggressive bias towards "heavier" transactions, combined with deterministic LPT anchors, significantly outperformed linear weighting (Gen 47, Score 3.73) by ensuring large tasks are packed early while maintaining just enough randomness.
- **Multi-Cycle ILS with Adaptive Perturbation:** **Gen 48** and **Gen 45** (Score 3.82) improved upon standard ILS by implementing a multi-cycle approach that alternates between local swaps and global insertions. Crucially, **Gen 48** varies the perturbation strength, applying a "double swap" kick every third cycle. This variable intensity helps the algorithm escape deep local optima that trapped previous generations (Gen 41, 3.76).
- **LPT-Anchored 1-Step Lookahead:** The top performers continue to rely on a specific 1-step lookahead that tentatively schedules the largest remaining transaction (LPT). This low-cost "sanity check" prevents myopic moves that block critical future work. Programs sticking to this formula (Gen 45, 48, 49) consistently scored above 3.70.
- **Hierarchical Candidate Filtering:** Successful programs employ a two-stage filter: first scoring a large pool of candidates with the cheap "Work Density" heuristic, and then running the expensive lookahead only on the top unique states. This resource allocation strategy maximizes search depth without sacrificing evaluation quality.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Deep (2-Step) Lookahead:** **Gen 42** (Score 3.41) attempted a 2-step lookahead to evaluate conflict urgency. The score dropped significantly compared to 1-step approaches, confirming that the exponential computational cost of deeper lookahead forces reductions in beam width or diversity, leading to a net negative impact on schedule quality.
- **Conflict/Urgency Metrics:** Programs that switched the primary heuristic from "Work Density" to "Conflict Volume" or "Urgency" (**Gen 43**, Score 3.37; **Gen 46**, Score 3.31) consistently underperformed. These static metrics fail to capture the dynamic "hole-filling" requirements of packing problems as well as the simple `Cost - TotalDuration` density metric.
- **Simulation-Heavy Construction:** **Gen 44** (Score 0.0) failed validation due to timeouts. The implementation relied on expensive full simulations inside the loop, reinforcing that heuristic proxies (like density) are mandatory for the construction phase to remain computationally feasible.

## Implementation Insights
- **Aggressive "Big Rock" Prioritization:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 48)** implements the squared weighting explicitly: `weights = [txn_durations[x]**2 for x in pool]`. This implementation detail is critical; it mathematically forces the random sampler to almost always pick bottleneck transactions, acting as a "soft" greedy approach that complements the "hard" greedy LPT anchors.
- **Alternating Descent Neighborhoods:** The local search function in **Gen 48** (`run_local_search_optimized`) strictly enforces an alternating loop: a full pass of Windowed Swaps ($w=5$) followed by a full pass of Windowed Insertions ($w=8$). The loop restarts if *either* phase finds an improvement, ensuring the schedule is locally optimal in terms of both sequence order and global placement.
- **State Deduplication Pre-Lookahead:** Both **Gen 49** and **Gen 48** utilize `frozenset(rem)` to track visited states and perform this check *before* the lookahead simulation. This prevents the algorithm from wasting simulation cycles on permutationally equivalent states (e.g., `[A, B]` vs `[B, A]` where `rem` is identical), effectively doubling the diversity of the beam.
- **Adaptive Kick Strength:** A subtle but effective pattern in **Gen 48** is the variable kick in the ILS loop: `num_swaps = 2 if (i % 3 == 0) else 1`. This periodic increase in perturbation energy allows the search to break out of basins of attraction that a single swap cannot overcome.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Squared" Breakout:** A distinct performance tier has emerged. While standard 1-step lookahead Beam + ILS programs plateaued around **3.72 - 3.77** (Gen 33, 41, 50), the introduction of Squared-Weighted sampling in **Gen 48** pushed the score to **3.89**. This suggests that standard LPT/Random sampling was still too uniform, missing critical packing combinations for complex workloads.
- **Heuristic Correlation:** There is a near-perfect correlation between the use of the `Cost - TotalDuration` heuristic and scores > 3.70. Conversely, every program using "Conflict Volume" or "Urgency" scored below 3.45.
- **Lookahead Depth Trade-off:** The data confirms a sharp decline in performance as lookahead complexity increases. 1-Step Lookahead (Gen 48, 45) yields ~3.80+, while 2-Step Lookahead (Gen 42) yields ~3.41. The cost of the extra step outweighs the informational gain.
- **Impact of ILS Refinement:** The progression from **Gen 41** (Score 3.76, basic ILS) to **Gen 45** (Score 3.82, Multi-Cycle ILS) demonstrates that the structure of the post-processing phase is just as critical as the construction phase. Adding alternating neighborhoods and multi-cycle repair adds ~0.06 to the score.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the Global Insights and the current best program (Generation 48), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Cubic-Weighted Stochastic Sampling**
    The shift from linear to squared weighting ($d^2$) was the primary driver of the recent performance leap (3.73 $\to$ 3.89). You should test **Cubic Weighting ($d^3$)** in the beam search sampling phase. A steeper probability curve will further prioritize the critical "heavy" transactions that determine the makespan, while the stochastic nature prevents the search from becoming purely greedy.

2.  **Multi-Target 1-Step Lookahead**
    The current lookahead validates candidates by tentatively scheduling only the *single* largest remaining transaction. You should expand this to evaluate the **Top-2 or Top-3 largest remaining transactions** and use the best resulting score. This prevents the algorithm from discarding a promising branch simply because the absolute largest item caused a conflict, whereas the second-largest might have fit perfectly, adding robustness with negligible overhead.

3.  **Block-Move Local Search Neighborhood**
    The current Iterated Local Search (ILS) relies on single-item Swaps and Insertions. You should implement a **Block Insertion Neighborhood** that moves contiguous subsequences of transactions (e.g., blocks of size 2 or 3) to new positions. This allows the algorithm to relocate efficient "sub-assemblies" of parallel transactions without breaking their internal structure, which single-item moves often destroy.

4.  **Ruin-and-Recreate Perturbation (LNS)**
    The current random swap "kick" is sometimes insufficient to escape deep local optima. You should introduce a **Ruin-and-Recreate** perturbation strategy (Large Neighborhood Search): remove a small set of random transactions (e.g., 3 to 5) from the schedule and re-insert them using a greedy best-fit logic. This structural disruption is often more effective than swaps for repairing "jammed" packing arrangements.

5.  **Stagnation-Based Adaptive Kicking**
    Instead of the current deterministic cycle (double swap every 3rd iteration), implement a reactive **Stagnation Counter**. Track the number of ILS cycles without a global improvement and dynamically increase the perturbation intensity (e.g., number of swaps or size of the ruin set) as the counter rises. This ensures the algorithm applies aggressive disruption only when trapped in a particularly stubborn local optimum.
