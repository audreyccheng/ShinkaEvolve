# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 51-60 and the new best program (Generation 60), here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Cubic-Weighted Stochastic Sampling:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 60, Score 4.02)** and **Gen 53 (Score 3.92)** upgraded the sampling bias from squared ($d^2$) to cubic ($d^3$) relative to transaction duration. This extremely aggressive weighting effectively forces the algorithm to prioritize bottleneck transactions almost exclusively, utilizing randomness only for tie-breaking among high-cost items, which proved superior to the previous squared approach (Gen 48, 3.89).
- **Ruin-and-Recreate Perturbation:** The top performers (**Gen 60**, **Gen 53**, **Gen 57**) replaced standard swap-based kicks with a "Ruin-and-Recreate" strategy in the ILS phase. By removing a random subsequence (size 3-5) and re-inserting the items using a greedy best-fit heuristic, the algorithm escapes local optima more effectively than block moves, pushing scores from ~3.50 to >3.90.
- **Multi-Target LPT Lookahead:** While previous successful iterations checked only the single largest remaining item, **Gen 60** implements a lookahead that evaluates compatibility with the *top-3* remaining LPT transactions. This broader horizon prevents the scheduler from making choices that might accommodate the immediate largest item but block the second or third largest, ensuring better packing efficiency.
- **Hybrid Deterministic/Stochastic Anchors:** **Gen 60** combines strictly deterministic selection (picking the top 2 LPT items automatically if available) with the cubic-weighted pool. This ensures the absolute critical path is never missed due to bad RNG, while the weighted pool handles the packing of non-critical items.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Conflict Volume & Urgency Metrics:** Programs attempting to switch back to "Conflict Volume" or "Urgency" heuristics (**Gen 51**, Score 3.39; **Gen 52**, Score 3.16; **Gen 54**, Score 3.28) consistently underperformed compared to "Work Density" approaches. The evaluation confirms that static conflict metrics cannot compete with the dynamic `Cost - TotalDuration` heuristic for this packing problem.
- **Block-Move Only Refinement:** While "Block Moves" preserve structure, programs relying primarily on them for ILS perturbation (**Gen 52, 55, 56**) plateaued around scores of 3.41–3.44. Without the destructive force of "Ruin-and-Recreate," these algorithms failed to reorganize the schedule significantly enough to find global optima.
- **Adaptive Stagnation Complexity:** **Gen 59** (Score 3.51) introduced complex logic to vary perturbation based on stagnation counters. This added implementation complexity but yielded lower scores than the simpler, consistently aggressive perturbation strategies found in Gen 53 and Gen 60.

## Implementation Insights
- **Greedy Re-insertion Logic:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 60)** implements the "Recreate" phase of ILS by sorting the removed items by duration (`removed.sort(key=..., reverse=True)`) and inserting them into the position that minimizes the cost increase. This mini-greedy repair step is crucial; randomly re-inserting items degrades the schedule quality too much to recover.
- **Power-Law Weighting Implementation:** **Gen 60** explicitly calculates `weights = [txn_durations[x]**3 for x in pool]`. This implementation detail transforms the probabilistic selection into a "soft" greedy search, ensuring that if a transaction is 2x larger than another, it is 8x more likely to be picked.
- **Filtered Lookahead Scope:** To manage the computational cost of checking multiple future targets, **Gen 60** iterates specifically over a pre-calculated list of `targets` (the intersection of the remaining set and the global sorted LPT list), limiting the check to at most 3 items. This prevents the $O(N^2)$ complexity blowup associated with full lookaheads.
- **Deduplicated State Evaluation:** Continuing the successful pattern from Gen 48, **Gen 60** uses `frozenset(new_rem)` to identify unique states *before* applying the expensive multi-target lookahead. This ensures that the limited simulation budget is spent on structurally distinct partial schedules.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Cubic" Performance Jump:** A clear performance tier has been established. Linear weighting peaked at ~3.73, Squared weighting (Gen 48) reached 3.89, and now Cubic weighting (**Gen 60**) has broken the 4.00 barrier (Score 4.02). This trend indicates that for these workloads, heuristic "greediness" correlates strongly with solution quality.
- **Perturbation Strategy vs. Score:** There is a distinct score gap between ILS strategies. Swap/Insertion based ILS programs generally scored between 3.30 and 3.55. Programs incorporating "Ruin-and-Recreate" (**Gen 53, 57, 60**) consistently scored above 3.80, proving it is the superior local search meta-heuristic for this domain.
- **Heuristic Stability:** The correlation between the `Cost - TotalDuration` heuristic and high scores (>3.80) remains 100%. Conversely, no program using alternative heuristics has broken the 3.60 mark in recent generations.
- **Lookahead Return on Investment:** Moving from 1-target lookahead (Gen 48, 3.89) to 3-target lookahead (Gen 60, 4.02) provided a measurable gain (+0.13), unlike previous attempts at deeper recursion (2-step lookahead) which caused regressions. Breadth (checking multiple candidates) appears more valuable than depth (checking recursive steps).

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generations 51-60 and the success of the Current Best Program (Gen 60), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Quartic-Weighted Stochastic Sampling ($d^4$)**
    The performance trend shows a direct correlation between the "steepness" of the weighting curve and score (Linear $\to$ Squared $\to$ Cubic). You should implement **Quartic Weighting ($d^4$)** for the stochastic pool in the beam search. This will virtually eliminate low-cost items from early consideration, ensuring the algorithm focuses even more aggressively on packing the heavy "rocks" first, while still retaining just enough randomness to break ties.

2.  **Expanded Multi-Target Lookahead**
    The move from 1-target to 3-target lookahead provided significant gains by identifying compatibility issues earlier. You should expand this to evaluate the **Top-5 or Top-6 largest remaining transactions**. Since the `frozenset` deduplication effectively limits the number of states, slightly increasing the validation breadth per state will increase the probability of finding a "perfect fit" for the critical path with minimal computational penalty.

3.  **Block-Based Local Search Neighborhood**
    While the current ILS uses single-item Swaps and Insertions, it lacks the ability to move "clusters" of transactions
