conflict_degree_beam_refinement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Optimizes the scheduling logic by introducing 'Conflict Degree' (count of dependencies) as a primary heuristic.
1.  **Metric Update**: Computes Conflict Degree for each transaction. High degree indicates a bottleneck node.
2.  **Beam Search**: Uses a tapered beam width (wide -> narrow). Selection probability is weighted by `Duration * (1 + ConflictDegree)`. Pruning prioritizes clearing high-degree nodes to unlock parallelism.
3.  **Refinement Phase 1**: Extracts the top 'Critical' items (high duration & degree) and exhaustively searches for their optimal insertion position in the constructed schedule.
4.  **Refinement Phase 2**: Performs a systematic windowed local search, iterating through the schedule and testing local moves for every transaction to smooth out inefficiencies.

def get_best_schedule(workload, num_seqs):
    """
    Get optimal schedule using Conflict-Aware Tapered Beam Search and Sampled Insertion Refinement.

    Key Logic:
    1. Pre-computation: detailed conflict analysis (R/W sets) to assign contention scores.
    2. Construction: Tapered Beam Search.
       - Beam width decreases linearly to shift computational budget to early, critical decisions.
       - Candidate selection biases towards high-duration and high-conflict transactions.
       - Scoring prefers lower makespan, tie-breaking with higher conflict resolution potential.
    3. Refinement: Local search that samples multiple insertion points to find steepest descent.

    Args:
        workload: Workload object
        num_seqs: Budget parameter used to scale beam width

    Returns:
        (lowest_makespan, schedule)
