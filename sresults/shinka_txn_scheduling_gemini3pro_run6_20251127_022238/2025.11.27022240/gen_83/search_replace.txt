<DESCRIPTION>
Optimizes the scheduling algorithm by intensifying heuristic biases and introducing controlled stochasticity based on successful trends.
1.  **Quartic ($d^4$) Beam Search**: Replaces cubic probability weighting with quartic ($d^4$) to aggressively bias the search towards urgent transactions. Increases deterministic anchors from 2 to 4 to stabilize the critical path search.
2.  **Hybrid Top-4 Lookahead**: Expands lookahead to the Top-4 urgent items and uses a hybrid metric (0.6 * min + 0.4 * avg) to balance 'unlocking potential' with 'general safety', reducing the risk of greedy dead-ends.
3.  **Threshold-Adaptive ILS**: Modifies the Iterated Local Search to use a larger 'Ruin' set (6-12 items) for deeper perturbations and implements Threshold Acceptance (0.5% tolerance) to allow the search to traverse fitness valleys and escape local optima.

    Get optimal schedule using Cubic-Weighted Beam Search and Stagnation-Based Adaptive ILS.

    Innovations:
    1. Cubic Sampling (d^3): heavily biases selection towards urgent tasks while maintaining
       stochastic diversity for beam search.
    2. Multi-Target Lookahead: evaluates candidates by checking if *any* of the top-3 urgent
       remaining items can follow efficiently.
    3. Adaptive Stagnation ILS: dynamically scales perturbation intensity (Swap -> Block Move
       -> Ruin & Recreate) based on search stagnation.
