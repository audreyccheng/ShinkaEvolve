-    Key Logic:
-    1. Pre-computation: detailed conflict analysis (R/W sets) to assign contention scores.
-    2. Construction: Tapered Beam Search.
-       - Beam width decreases linearly to shift computational budget to early, critical decisions.
-       - Candidate selection biases towards high-duration and high-conflict transactions.
-       - Scoring prefers lower makespan, tie-breaking with higher conflict resolution potential.
-    3. Refinement: Local search that samples multiple insertion points to find steepest descent.
