+    Get optimal schedule using Lookahead Beam Search and Iterated Local Search (ILS).
+    
+    Key Innovations:
+    1. Lookahead Beam Search: Evaluates candidates not just by immediate cost, but by the 
+       cost after tentatively scheduling the next most urgent transaction. This prevents 
+       shortsighted greedy choices that block critical paths.
+    2. Iterated Local Search (ILS): Escapes local optima by applying random perturbations
