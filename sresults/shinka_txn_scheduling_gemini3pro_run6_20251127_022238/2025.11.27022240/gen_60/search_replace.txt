<DESCRIPTION>
This update implements three major improvements to the scheduling algorithm derived from high-performing strategies in previous generations:

1.  **Cubic-Weighted Stochastic Sampling**: Replaces linear weighting with cubic weighting ($d^3$) in the beam search expansion. This sharply increases the probability of selecting "heavy" transactions (those with high individual costs/durations) early in the schedule, which is critical for reducing makespan in resource-constrained problems.
2.  **Multi-Target Lookahead**: Enhances the 1-step lookahead mechanism to evaluate the top-3 largest remaining transactions (instead of just the single largest). This makes the lookahead more robust, ensuring that a candidate schedule isn't discarded just because one specific future transaction conflicts, when others might fit perfectly.
3.  **Ruin-and-Recreate Perturbation (ILS)**: Replaces the simple random swap perturbation in the Iterated Local Search with a "Ruin-and-Recreate" strategy (Large Neighborhood Search). It removes a small set of random transactions and re-inserts them using a greedy best-fit heuristic. This structural disruption is far more effective at escaping local optima in packing/scheduling problems than local swaps.

These changes collectively aim to improve the global search capability (via better sampling) and the local refinement capability (via smarter perturbation), targeting a higher combined score.

def get_best_schedule(workload, num_seqs):
    """
    Get optimal schedule using Lookahead Beam Search with Iterated Local Search.

    Algorithm:
    1. Beam Search with 1-Step Lookahead:
       - Candidates are first filtered by immediate heuristic (Cost - TotalDuration).
       - Top candidates are re-evaluated by tentatively adding the next largest transaction (LPT).
       - This helps detect if a locally good move blocks a critical future transaction.
    2. Weighted Sampling:
       - Uses transaction duration as weights for random sampling to bias exploration towards heavy items.
    3. Iterated Local Search (ILS):
       - Applies a "Perturbation and Repair" strategy: optimize -> perturb (random kick) -> optimize again.

        workload: Workload object containing transaction data
