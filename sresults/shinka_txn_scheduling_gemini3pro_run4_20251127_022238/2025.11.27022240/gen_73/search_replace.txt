</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
1.  **Greedy Diversity**: Modifies the greedy construction loop to use a fixed baseline configuration (`alpha=0.1`, `threshold=0.9`) for the first candidate to ensure stability. For subsequent candidates, it employs a wider range of `alpha` (up to 0.4) and `threshold` (0.75-0.99) to explore diverse structural packings (e.g., packing long transactions aggressively vs minimizing current cost).
2.  **Split Block Mutations**: Refines the LAHC mutation operator by splitting the single "Block Shift" into "Micro Block Shift" (size 2-4, frequent) for local optimization and "Macro Block Shift" (size 5-12, less frequent) for moving larger dependency chains. This allows the algorithm to tackle both fine-grained and coarse-grained scheduling conflicts more effectively.
