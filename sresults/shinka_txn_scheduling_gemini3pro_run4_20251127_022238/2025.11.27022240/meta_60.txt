# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 50-59, the previous insights, and the source code of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34, Score: 3.62)**, here are the detailed optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Binary "Sprint/Marathon" Refinement Structure:** The most effective resource allocation strategy remains the distinct two-phase approach used by the **Current Best Program (Gen 34, Score: 3.62)** and validly replicated in **Generation 55 (Score: 3.57)**. This structure (Short Sprint on Top 3 -> Deep Marathon on Top 1) consistently outperforms the three-stage "Funnel" architectures (Warmup -> Sprint -> Marathon) seen in **Generation 50 (3.45)** and **Generation 54 (3.46)**, which appear to dilute the iteration budget across too many intermediate steps.
- **Deterministic Baseline with "Big Rocks" Injection:** The highest-scoring programs build a safety floor by forcing the first candidate to be a deterministic, full-scan greedy schedule, while subsequent candidates use "Big Rocks" prioritization. **Gen 34** guarantees this baseline, and **Generation 52 (Score: 3.61)**—the closest competitor—succeeded by using a similar diversity strategy where "Big Rocks" are prioritized to prevent validity bottlenecks, combined with a stagnation kick to escape local optima.
- **Specific Operator Ratio (60/30/10):** The **Current Best Program (Gen 34)** employs a precise operator mix: 60% Single Insert, 30% Block Insert (size 2-4), and 10% Swap. This specific ratio outperforms the complex, adaptive, or "sampled greedy" operators attempted in **Generation 56 (3.53)** and **Generation 58 (3.53)**, suggesting that high-frequency simple moves combined with moderate structural changes (Block Insert) are more efficient than computationally expensive "smart" operators.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Three-Stage Funnel Architectures:** Implementation of "Warmup" or "Filter" stages prior to the Sprint/Marathon phases consistently yielded lower scores. **Generation 50 (3.45)**, **Generation 54 (3.46)**, and **Generation 57 (3.44)** all utilized three-stage funnels. These additional stages consume computational time that is better spent on the final "Marathon" depth, preventing the algorithm from reaching the convergence seen in **Gen 34 (2500 iterations)**.
- **Over-Reliance on "Sampled Greedy" Operators:** Programs like **Generation 58 (3.53)** and **Generation 56 (3.53)** incorporated "Sampled Greedy Insert" operators within the LAHC loop. While theoretically sound, the computational overhead of evaluating multiple positions for a single move reduces the total number of iterations possible within the time limit compared to **Gen 34's** fast, random insertion logic, resulting in a lower net score.
- **Unstructured Hybridization:** **Generation 57 (3.44)** attempted to hybridize "Big Rocks" with a funnel but lacked the strict pre-refinement sorting found in the best program. Without sorting candidates by raw cost *before* applying expensive local search, the algorithm wastes cycles optimizing poor initial candidates.

## Implementation Insights
- **Pre-Sprint Candidate Sorting:** A critical, often overlooked detail in the **Current Best Program (Gen 34)** is the line `candidates_pool.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` executed immediately before the Sprint phase. This ensures that the computationally expensive "Sprint" (300 iterations) is only applied to the mathematically superior greedy starts. Programs that applied filtering *during* or *after* initial refinement steps (like **Gen 54**) failed to maximize this efficiency.
- **Fixed vs. Randomized Heuristic Alpha:** While **Generation 52 (3.61)** achieved success with randomized parameters, the **Current Best Program (Gen 34)** uses a hardcoded alpha of `0.4` for the cost function `cost - (0.4 * duration)`. This specific constant appears to be a stable local optimum for this specific workload set, balancing makespan reduction with the "Big Rocks" prioritization more reliably than adaptive schemes.
- **Block Insertion Logic:** The implementation of block moves in **Gen 34** is simple but robust: `block_size = random.randint(2, 4)`. This small window size is crucial; it allows the algorithm to move dependent transaction chains without disrupting the entire schedule structure, which is a common failure point in programs that try to move larger blocks or use unconstrained swaps.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "3.60" Efficiency Barrier:** There is a distinct performance tier separating the best approaches. Only **Gen 34 (3.62)** and **Gen 52 (3.61)** have broken the 3.60 barrier in recent generations. The cluster of programs using three-stage funnels (**Gen 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58**) plateaued between **3.44 and 3.57**, confirming that architectural complexity is yielding diminishing returns compared to the streamlined depth of Gen 34.
- **Depth vs. Breadth Trade-off:** The data confirms that search *depth* (iterations per candidate) is the primary driver of high scores. **Gen 34** allocates 2500 iterations to a single winner. In contrast, **Generation 57 (3.44)** and **Gen 50 (3.45)** distributed their budgets across multiple stages or more candidates, resulting in "shallow" optimization that failed to resolve complex dependency conflicts in the final schedule.
- **Convergence of Greedy Heuristics:** Almost every program in this batch (Gen 50-59) successfully implemented valid schedules with decent scores (>3.40), primarily due to the universal adoption of "Big Rocks" or "Safety Net" heuristics. The differentiation in score now comes almost exclusively from the efficiency of the LAHC refinement phase and the specific operator probabilities.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34)** and the global insights from Generations 50-59, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Diversity-Driven Parameter Randomization**: While preserving the first candidate as the strict baseline (fixed `alpha=0.4`), generate the subsequent candidates by randomly sampling `alpha` from `[0.2, 0.6]` and the Big Rock threshold from `[0.85, 0.95]`. This introduces structural diversity into the initial pool, increasing the probability of finding a topology that refines better than the fixed-parameter candidates.
2.  **Integrate Stagnation-Based Perturbation ("Kick")**: Enhance the "Marathon" phase by tracking the iteration of the last improvement. If the score stagnates for a set window (e.g.,
