</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I am replacing the Simulated Annealing and fixed-sample Greedy approach with a more robust Multi-Stage Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC) and an Adaptive "Big Rocks" Greedy Construction.

Key improvements:
1.  **Adaptive Greedy**: Instead of a fixed number of random samples, we now dynamically identify "Big Rocks" (transactions with length >= 90% of max remaining) and prioritize them. We also use a weighted scoring function (`cost - alpha * length`) to break ties in favor of longer transactions, promoting better packing.
2.  **Multi-Stage Refinement (Sprint & Marathon)**: Instead of only optimizing the single best greedy candidate, we perform a short LAHC "Sprint" on the top 3 distinct candidates. This ensures we don't discard a structurally superior schedule just because it had a slightly higher initial cost. The winner then undergoes a "Marathon" LAHC.
3.  **Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC)**: Replaces SA. LAHC is parameter-free (besides history length) and often performs better on scheduling problems by allowing controlled degradation to escape local optima without the complex cooling schedule of SA.
4.  **Block Shift Operator**: Added a mutation operator that moves contiguous blocks of 2-4 transactions. This preserves local dependency chains that have been optimized, allowing them to be relocated together.

    """
    Get optimal schedule using Multi-Start Greedy Construction followed by Simulated Annealing.

    Algorithm Design:
    1.  **Metric-Aware Greedy**: Constructs candidates by selecting transactions that minimize
        makespan increase. Ties are broken by preferring longer transactions (Best Fit Descending).
    2.  **Local Refinement**: Applies Adjacent Swap Descent to every greedy candidate to
        ensure we compare local minima.
    3.  **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: The best candidate undergoes a long SA phase.
        -   Start Temp: 2.5
        -   Cooling: 0.98
        -   Moves:
            -   Adjacent Swap (40%)
            -   Insertion/Shift (60%) - Weighted higher as it is structurally more impactful.

    This approach combines the "global" exploration of multiple greedy starts with the
    "local" hill-climbing capability of Swap Descent and the "basin-hopping" capability of SA.

    Args:
        workload: Workload object
        num_seqs: Number of random starts

    Returns:
        Tuple of (lowest makespan, corresponding schedule)
