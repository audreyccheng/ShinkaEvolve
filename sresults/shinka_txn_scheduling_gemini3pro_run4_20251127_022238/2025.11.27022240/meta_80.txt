# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 70-79, previous insights, and the source code of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34, Score: 3.62)**, here are the detailed optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Binary "Sprint/Marathon" Architecture:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 34, Score: 3.62)** validates that a two-phase refinement strategy (Short Sprint on Top 3 -> Deep Marathon on Top 1) is superior to complex funnels. **Generation 77 (Score: 3.57)** and **Generation 79 (Score: 3.51)** successfully replicated this Sprint/Marathon structure, significantly outperforming **Generation 76 (Score: 3.36)** and **Generation 70 (Score: 3.46)** which utilized standard or multi-stage funnels. The data confirms that allocating the majority of the computational budget to a single "winner" is more effective than broad filtering.
- **Hierarchical Block Mutation Constraints:** A critical factor in **Gen 34** is the specific constraint on block moves: `block_size = random.randint(2, 4)`. **Generation 74 (Score: 3.60)**, the highest performer in this new batch, approached this effectiveness by implementing "Multi-scale block mutations" (distinguishing between micro and macro moves). This confirms that manipulating small, contiguous dependency chains is the most effective operator for this problem, whereas single swaps or large block moves disrupt schedule validity.
- **Deterministic Polishing/Flooring:** **Gen 34** forces the first candidate to be a full-scan greedy schedule. **Generation 75 (Score: 3.58)** mimicked this success by applying a "Deterministic Swap Polish" immediately after greedy construction. This pattern ensures the search begins from a high-quality local minimum, protecting against the variance of randomized initialization.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Large Neighborhood Search (LNS):** **Generation 78 (Score: 3.48)** attempted to use LNS by removing and greedily re-inserting items. This approach failed to compete with the **Current Best (3.62)** or **Gen 74 (3.60)** because the computational cost of the "repair" logic drastically reduced the total number of iterations possible within the time limit. Simple, blind mutations (as used in Gen 34) allow for thousands more iterations, resulting in better convergence.
- **Explicit "Stagnation Kicks" without History Management:** Several programs in this batch (**Gen 70, 71, 73**) implemented "Stagnation Kicks" to escape local optima, yet scores plateaued around **3.46-3.51**. In contrast, **Gen 34** relies solely on the standard LAHC history mechanism (`history_len = 50`) to handle stagnation. The overhead of detecting stagnation and constructing a "kick" often interrupts the natural descent of the hill climber in short-duration runs.
- **Complex Cooling Schedules:** **Generation 76** and **Generation 72** implemented cooling phases or "Final Descent" stages but achieved lower scores (**3.36** and **3.52** respectively). The transition from LAHC to strict hill climbing effectively cuts the search short, freezing the algorithm in a local optimum rather than allowing LAHC to drift out of it, as Gen 34 does until the very end.

## Implementation Insights
- **Pre-Optimization Sorting:** A subtle but decisive implementation detail in **Gen 34** is `candidates_pool.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` executed *before* the Sprint phase. This ensures the expensive optimization logic is applied strictly to the mathematically best seeds. **Generation 70** and **Gen 76** processed candidates through funnels without this strict pre-sort, likely wasting "Sprint" cycles on candidates that had no chance of becoming the global best.
- **Cost-Duration Heuristic Tuning:** **Gen 34** uses a specific weighted heuristic: `cost - (0.4 * txn_durations[t])`. This formula balances minimizing the immediate makespan increase (cost) with the strategic value of scheduling long transactions early. Programs in the current batch utilizing generic "Big Rocks" heuristics without this specific cost-offset calculation (e.g., **Gen 72**) failed to break the 3.55 barrier.
- **Operator Probability Distribution:** **Gen 34** utilizes a static distribution of **60% Insert, 30% Block Insert, 10% Swap**. Programs like **Gen 78** or **Gen 71** that utilized adaptive operator selection or complex history-based operator weighting introduced processing overhead that did not yield a better search trajectory than Gen 34's simple, high-throughput random selection.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Complexity vs. Iteration" Trade-off:** There is a clear inverse correlation between algorithmic complexity and score. **Gen 34 (Score: 3.62)** is code-light and iteration-heavy (2500 iterations for the Marathon phase). **Generation 74 (Score: 3.60)** came closest by focusing on effective mutations, but other complex solutions like **Gen 78 (LNS)** and **Gen 70 (Complex Funnel)** dropped below 3.50. The processing time consumed by "smart" logic directly cannibalizes the iteration count needed for deep optimization.
- **Convergence Ceiling:** The batch results show a "soft ceiling" at **3.60**. Only **Gen 34 (3.62)** and **Gen 74 (3.60)** have reached this level. The majority of competent "smart" algorithms (**Gen 71, 72, 73, 75, 77, 79**) clustered tightly between **3.50 and 3.58**. This suggests that 3.58 is the limit for algorithms that prioritize exploration/mechanisms, while breaking 3.60 requires the raw exploitation speed of a streamlined LAHC loop.
- **Stability of the Sprint/Marathon Model:** The programs that adopted the Sprint/Marathon structure (**Gen 77, 79**) consistently scored in the upper quartile (>3.50), while those using other structures had much higher variance (**Gen 76** at 3.36 vs **Gen 74** at 3.60). This indicates the Sprint/Marathon model is the most robust framework for this specific problem instance.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the detailed analysis of Generation 34 and the global insights from Generations 70-79, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Stochastic Heuristic Parameters**: Modify the greedy construction phase to randomize the influential constants for each candidate generation. Instead of a fixed `alpha=0.4` and threshold `0.9`, sample `alpha` from `[0.2, 0.6]` and the "Big Rock" threshold from `[0.80, 0.95]`. This creates a structurally diverse initial pool, preventing the "Sprint" phase from optimizing three nearly identical variations of the same heuristic pattern.

2.  **Deploy Multi-Scale Block Mutations**: Refine the mutation logic by splitting the successful "Block Insert" operator into two distinct tiers: a frequent "Micro-Block" (size 2-4, ~30% probability) for local optimization, and a new, infrequent "Macro-Block" (size 5-10, ~5% probability) for structural changes. This allows the algorithm to occasionally relocate larger chains of dependent transactions—necessary to break the 3.60 score ceiling—without disrupting the fine-grained search.

3.  **Enforce a "Final Descent" Cooling Phase**: Modify the `run_lahc` function to switch from Late Acceptance logic to strict Hill Climbing (accept only if `new_cost < current_cost`) for the final 20% of the iteration budget. This ensures that the algorithm does not end its run while drifting through a worse state allowed by the LAHC history buffer, guaranteeing convergence to the true bottom of the basin.

4.  **Integrate Low-Overhead Stagnation Kicks**: Add a simple counter to the "Marathon" loop that tracks iterations since the last global improvement (`best_cost`). If this counter exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., 400 iterations), trigger a "Kick"—a forced, unverified move of a larger block or multiple random swaps—to dislodge the search from local optima without the computational expense of complex history analysis.

5.  **Adopt a Dynamic Construction Heuristic**: Evolve the greedy weighted selection to use a decaying `alpha` rather than a static one. Start with a high `alpha` (e.g., 0.6) to aggressively prioritize long transactions ("Big Rocks") at the beginning of the schedule, and linearly decay it to 0.1 by the end of the sequence. This aligns the heuristic with the strategy of "place rocks first, fill sand later."
