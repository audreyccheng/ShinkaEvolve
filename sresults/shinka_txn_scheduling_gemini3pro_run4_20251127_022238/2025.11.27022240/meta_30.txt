# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the new program summaries (Generations 20-29), previous insights, and the source code of the **Current Best Program (Generation 14)**, here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **"Big Rocks" with Explicit Injection**: The most consistent high-performing strategy involves explicitly prioritizing long transactions. **Generation 14 (Score: 3.61)** forces the top 4 longest transactions into the greedy candidate set. Similarly, the high-scoring **Generation 28 (Score: 3.57)** and **Generation 26 (Score: 3.53)** utilized adaptive "Big Rocks" heuristics. This confirms that ensuring bottleneck transactions are scheduled early is a prerequisite for high scores (above 3.50).
- **Plateau Surfing vs. Late Acceptance**: While **Generation 14** achieved the highest score (3.61) using a simple Hill Climbing approach that accepts sideways moves (`new_cost <= current_cost`), **Generation 28 (3.57)** and **Generation 26 (3.53)** achieved nearly comparable results using Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC). This suggests that the ability to traverse non-improving regions of the search space is critical, whether through "equal cost" acceptance (Gen 14) or history-based acceptance (LAHC).
- **Multi-Stage Budget Allocation**: **Generation 26 (3.53)** and **Generation 28 (3.57)** introduced a "Sprint and Marathon" strategy—quickly refining multiple candidates to filter them, then dedicating a large optimization budget to the winner. While slightly behind Gen 14, this pattern proved significantly more effective than uniform refinement strategies seen in **Generation 21 (3.38)**.
- **Insertion-Dominant Mutation**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 14)** uses a 70% Insertion / 30% Swap split. The high-scoring **Generation 28** also relied heavily on block and single shift (insertion) operators. This confirms that moving transactions to new positions (insertion) is more effective for makespan minimization than exchanging positions (swap), likely because insertion preserves the relative order of other dependencies.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Restricted Neighborhood Search**: **Generation 20 (Score: 3.28)** utilized "adjacent swap descent." This underperformed compared to programs using global shift/block operators. Restricting moves to adjacent neighbors prevents the algorithm from resolving structural bottlenecks where a transaction needs to move across the entire schedule.
- **Over-Complex Optimization Chains**: **Generation 25 (Score: 3.26)** combined Big Rocks, Hill Climbing, *and* Simulated Annealing. This complexity likely diluted the instruction budget, preventing any single stage from converging fully. Simpler, focused refinement loops (like Gen 14's single loop or Gen 28's LAHC) consistently outperformed these multi-algorithm hybrids.
- **Pure Greedy without Refinement Depth**: While greedy construction is good, relying too heavily on it with insufficient refinement leads to stagnation. Programs that didn't implement deep "Marathon" style refinement or the specific "Sideways" logic of Gen 14 generally capped out around 3.30 (e.g., **Gen 22**, **Gen 24**), failing to reach the 3.50+ tier.

## Implementation Insights
- **Tuple-Based Cost Minimization**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 14)** implements a concise and powerful tie-breaking mechanism directly in the greedy loop: `cost_tuple = (cost, -txn_durations[t])`. By minimizing this tuple, the program automatically selects the longest transaction (largest negative number) whenever the primary cost (makespan) is tied, without needing conditional branches.
- **Deterministic Baseline + Stochastic Exploration**: **Generation 14** employs a specific pattern where the *first* greedy sequence performs a full scan of all candidates (deterministic), while subsequent sequences use random sampling. This guarantees the solution is at least as good as a deterministic greedy approach, providing a high "floor" for performance that purely stochastic approaches (like **Gen 20**) might miss.
- **Conditional Acceptance Logic**: The difference between a score of ~3.30 and 3.61 lies in the acceptance criteria. **Generation 14** uses `if new_cost <= current_cost:` (accepts equal). **Generation 28** uses LAHC (accepts if better than history). Standard hill climbers (implied in lower scoring gens) often use `if new_cost < current_cost:` (strict improvement), which causes premature termination on the "flat" landscapes common in bin-packing/scheduling problems.
- **Weighted Heuristics**: **Generation 28** implemented a cost function `cost - alpha * length` during construction. This is a mathematical equivalent to Gen 14's tuple sorting, effectively blending makespan minimization with duration prioritization, leading to the second-highest score (3.57).

## Performance Analysis
- **The "3.50 Barrier"**: Only three programs have broken the 3.50 score barrier: **Generation 14 (3.61)**, **Generation 28 (3.57)**, and **Generation 26 (3.53)**. All three share two traits: aggressive "Big Rocks" prioritization during construction and a refinement mechanism that allows non-improving moves (Sideways HC or LAHC).
- **LAHC vs. Sideways HC**: The **Current Best (Gen 14)** uses Sideways Hill Climbing, while the runner-up **(Gen 28)** uses LAHC. The slight edge for Gen 14 (3.61 vs 3.57) suggests that for this specific problem size, simply accepting equal-cost moves allows for sufficient exploration without the risk of accepting significantly worse solutions that LAHC permits, making it slightly more efficient per instruction.
- **Construction vs. Refinement**: Scores in the 3.20–3.30 range (Gen 20, 23, 25) often have decent construction but lack effective refinement. The jump to 3.48+ (Gen 19, 29) requires strong construction. The final jump to 3.61 (Gen 14) requires *both* "Big Rocks" construction and a specific, efficient local search operator (Insertion-biased Sideways HC).

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 14) and recent high-performing generations (20-29), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC)**: Replace the current "Sideways" Hill Climbing (`new_cost <= current_cost`) with Late Acceptance Hill Climbing, which accepts a move if the new cost is better than or equal to the cost $L$ iterations ago (e.g., $L=50$). This generalizes the successful plateau-surfing strategy of Generation 14 by allowing controlled temporary degradation to escape local optima, a technique that helped Generation 28 achieve the second-highest score.
2.  **Adopt Multi-Candidate "Sprint" Refinement**: Modify the selection logic to retain the top 3 distinct schedules from the greedy sampling phase instead of just the single best one. Perform a short "pre-optimization" (e.g., 200 iterations) on each of these candidates before selecting the winner for the full optimization budget, ensuring the algorithm doesn't discard schedules that are structurally superior for refinement despite having a slightly higher initial greedy cost.
3.  **Introduce Block Insertion Operators**: Expand the insertion-heavy mutation logic (currently 70% single insertion) to include "Block Moves," where a contiguous sequence of 2-3 transactions is moved to a new position. This builds on the insight that insertion preserves ordering better than swaps, allowing the algorithm to relocate optimized dependency chains intact without breaking their internal structure.
4.  **Dynamic "Big Rocks" Candidate Pool**: Instead of a fixed limit of 4 "Big Rocks" in the greedy candidate pool, implement an adaptive threshold that includes all transactions with durations within a certain percentage (e.g., 85-90%) of the maximum remaining transaction duration. This ensures that workloads with clusters of long transactions have all critical bottlenecks evaluated for early placement, preventing the exclusion of high-impact items due to an arbitrary counter.
5.  **Weighted Score Greedy Selection**: Transition from the strict lexicographical tie-breaking `(cost, -duration)` to a weighted scoring function like `score = cost - (alpha * duration)`. This allows the greedy heuristic to tolerate a marginal increase in immediate makespan if it permits scheduling a significantly longer transaction ("Big Rock") earlier, effectively trading minor short-term inefficiency for better long-term packing.
