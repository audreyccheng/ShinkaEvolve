</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
1.  **Stagnation Kick**: Added a `kick` mechanism to `run_lahc`. If the algorithm is in the Marathon phase (`enable_kick=True`) and hasn't improved for 500 iterations, it shuffles a random segment (size 8-16) of the schedule. This helps escape deep local optima that standard mutations can't handle.
2.  **Decaying Alpha Greedy**: Updated the Greedy construction phase to use a decaying `alpha` (weight for transaction length). It starts high (0.2-0.6) to prioritize placing "Big Rocks" (long transactions) early in the schedule, and linearly decays to 20% of its value to prioritize "Best Fit" (Cost) for filling gaps later. This implements the "Big Rocks First" heuristic more dynamically.
3.  **Refined Mutations**: Tuned the LAHC mutation probabilities based on recommendations: increased Micro-Block shifts (30%) for local polish, decreased Macro-Block shifts (5%) to reduce disruption, and maintained high Single Shift probability.
