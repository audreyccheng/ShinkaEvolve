# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the new program summaries (Generations 30-39), previous insights, and the source code of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34, Score: 3.62)**, here are the updated optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **"Sprint and Marathon" Resource Allocation**: The most significant trend in the top-performing programs (Generations 33, 34, 35, 36) is the explicit division of the refinement budget. **Generation 34 (Score: 3.62)** uses a "Sprint" (300 iterations) on the top 3 candidates to filter them, followed by a "Marathon" (2500 iterations) on the single winner. This proved superior to uniform refinement strategies, efficiently directing computational power where it yields the highest return.
- **Weighted Greedy with "Big Rocks" Injection**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 34)** refines the greedy construction by combining a cost function `Cost - (Alpha * Duration)` with an explicit mechanism that forces high-duration transactions ("Big Rocks") into the greedy candidate pool if they exceed a threshold (90% of max remaining duration). This ensures that bottleneck transactions are not skipped due to local cost penalties early in the schedule.
- **Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC)**: While previous high scorers relied on simple sideways hill climbing, **Generation 34** achieved the new high score of 3.62 using LAHC with a history length of 50. This confirms that a mechanism allowing momentary degradation in solution quality (based on history) is necessary to escape the local optima found at the 3.60+ scoring tier.
- **Block-Based Mutation Operators**: **Generation 34** employs a specific mutation distribution: 60% Single Insert, 30% Block Insert (moving chunks of 2-4 items), and only 10% Swap. The inclusion and significant weighting (30%) of block insertions allow the algorithm to move entire dependency chains or efficient sub-sequences together, which is critical for fine-tuning schedules without breaking existing optimizations.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Variable-Strategy Construction**: **Generation 37 (Score: 3.21)** attempted to use varying `alpha` weights and strategies (balancing Longest-Job-First vs. Best-Fit) dynamically. This failed to perform well, likely because the lack of a consistent, aggressive heuristic prevented the algorithm from reliably establishing a strong baseline structure ("Big Rocks" placement) before refinement.
- **Shallow Refinement**: **Generation 30 (Score: 3.29)** utilized a valid "Dynamic Big Rocks" construction but failed to break the 3.30 barrier. The feedback indicates that while initialization was good, the refinement phase lacked the depth or the "Marathon" intensity seen in Gen 34, causing the solution to stagnate in local optima.
- **Over-reliance on Randomness without Structure**: Programs that relied too heavily on random sampling without the strict "Big Rocks" enforcement (like portions of **Generation 37**) consistently underperformed compared to those that structurally forced long transactions into the schedule early.

## Implementation Insights
- **Heuristic Cost Function Tuning**: The **Current Best Program (Gen 34)** uses a specific alpha value of `0.4` in its greedy scoring: `score = cost - (0.4 * txn_durations[t])`. This precise tuning balances the minimization of gaps (cost) with the prioritization of length (duration). Lower-scoring variations often lacked this specific blend or used purely random/adaptive weights that failed to converge.
- **Deterministic Baseline + Stochastic Search**: **Generation 34** strictly enforces that the *first* generated schedule is a deterministic full-scan greedy approach, while subsequent candidates use random sampling. This guarantees that the final result is at least as good as the best deterministic heuristic, raising the performance floor significantly.
- **Tuple-Based Sorting for Candidates**: The efficient selection logic in **Generation 34** sorts candidates for the Sprint phase using `candidates_pool.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`. By generating multiple greedy candidates and filtering them *before* heavy optimization, the implementation effectively reduces the search space for the expensive LAHC routine.

## Performance Analysis
- **Breaking the 3.60 Barrier**: The progression from **Generation 14 (3.61)** to **Generation 34 (3.62)** represents a shift from "Sideways Hill Climbing" to "Late Acceptance Hill Climbing." While Gen 14 was highly effective, the addition of a history buffer (LAHC) and Block Insert operators in Gen 34 provided the extra flexibility needed to squeeze out the final efficiency gains.
- **Consistency of Multi-Stage Refinement**: All programs in this batch that scored above 3.50 (**Gen 33, 34, 35, 36, 38**) utilized some form of multi-stage (Sprint/Marathon) refinement. In contrast, programs lacking this hierarchy (Gen 30, 37) clustered around 3.20–3.30. This structural pattern is now a verified requirement for top-tier performance.
- **Greedy vs. Local Search Balance**: The high scores rely on a symbiotic relationship where the Weighted Greedy construction (scoring ~3.2-3.3 raw) positions the "Big Rocks" correctly, and the deep LAHC refinement (pushing to 3.5+) packs the smaller transactions around them. Neither component works in isolation to reach the 3.60 mark; Gen 30 proved that good construction without deep search is insufficient, while previous random-start search algorithms failed to organize the heavy items efficiently.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34)** and the recent high-performing trends, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Diversity-Driven Parameter Randomization**: Instead of using a fixed `alpha=0.4` and `90%` threshold for all greedy candidates, sample `alpha` from a range (e.g., `0.3` to `0.6`) and the "Big Rock" threshold from a range (e.g., `0.80` to `0.95`) for each generated sequence. This creates a structurally diverse pool of initial candidates for the Sprint phase, increasing the probability of finding a baseline that scales better with optimization.
2.  **Adopt a "Funnel" Refinement Hierarchy**: Extend the "Sprint/Marathon" concept into a three-stage funnel. Run a rapid pre-check (e.g., 50 iterations) on **all** generated candidates to filter out unstable schedules, then promote the top 3-5 to the "Sprint" (300 iterations), and finally select the single winner for the "Marathon." This ensures that schedules with high potential aren't discarded simply due to a slightly higher initial greedy cost.
3.  **Integrate "Greedy Insert" Mutation**: Supplement the random mutation operators with a "Greedy Insert" operator (assigned a low probability, e.g., 5-10%). This operator removes a randomly selected transaction and deterministically re-inserts it at the position that minimizes the sequence cost. This adds a precise, exploitation-focused move that complements the exploration of random block moves and LAHC.
4.  **Enhance Block Mutation Scalability**: Increase the maximum size of the Block Insert operator from the current 2-4 items to a wider range (e.g., 2-8 items). As the optimization deepens, the algorithm needs to move larger stabilized sub-structures (dependency chains) intact to find better global arrangements without breaking local efficiencies.
5.  **Add Stagnation-Based Perturbation (Iterated Local Search)**: Modify the "Marathon" LAHC phase to detect stagnation. If the best found cost does not improve for a set number of iterations (e.g., 500), apply a "Kick" perturbation—such as shuffling a specific segment of the schedule or performing multiple random swaps—to forcibly eject the search from deep local optima before resuming the LAHC logic.
