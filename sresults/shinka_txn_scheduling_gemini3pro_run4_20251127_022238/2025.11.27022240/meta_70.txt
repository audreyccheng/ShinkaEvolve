# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 60-69, the previous global insights, and the source code of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34, Score: 3.62)**, here are the detailed optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Binary "Sprint/Marathon" Resource Allocation:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 34, Score: 3.62)** validates that a two-phase refinement strategy (Short Sprint on Top 3 -> Deep Marathon on Top 1) is superior to multi-stage funnels. While **Generation 60** and **Generation 62** attempted three-stage funnels (Warmup -> Sprint -> Marathon), they only achieved scores of **3.55** and **3.52** respectively, confirming that adding intermediate stages dilutes the iteration budget required for deep convergence.
- **Deterministic "Safety Floor" with Stochastic Diversity:** A crucial pattern in **Gen 34** is forcing the first candidate to be a deterministic full-scan greedy schedule while subsequent candidates utilize stochastic "Big Rocks" heuristics. This guarantees a baseline quality while exploring the solution space. **Generation 68 (Score: 3.55)** successfully mimicked this by adding a deterministic "Polish" step to its greedy construction, achieving one of the highest scores in this batch.
- **High-Frequency Random Mutation over Smart Sampling:** The specific operator mix in **Gen 34** (60% Random Insert, 30% Block Insert, 10% Swap) outperforms computationally expensive "smart" operators. **Generation 68** implemented "Sampled Best-Fit Mutations" but plateaued at **3.55**. The computational cost of evaluating multiple positions for a single move reduces the total search depth compared to Gen 34’s fast, random blind moves.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Three-Stage "Funnel" Architectures:** Despite frequent attempts in this batch (**Gen 60, 62, 66**), algorithms utilizing a "Warmup" or three-layer filtering process consistently failed to break the 3.60 barrier, plateauing between **3.42** and **3.55**. The overhead of managing an extra filtering stage consumes time that is better spent on the final optimization of the single best candidate.
- **Complex "Reversal" Operators:** **Generation 64 (Score: 3.52)** introduced block reversals into the operator mix. While theoretically useful for TSP-like problems, in transaction scheduling with heavy dependencies, reversing a block often violates precedence constraints, leading to high rejection rates or invalid states that waste computational cycles compared to the simple "Block Insert" used in **Gen 34**.
- **Heavy "Hotness" or "Contention" Heuristics:** **Generation 65 (Score: 3.55)** introduced a "Hotness-Aware" heuristic to calculate transaction contention. While the score was strong, it did not surpass **Gen 34 (3.62)**. The CPU time spent calculating contention matrices likely reduced the available time for the LAHC refinement loop, proving that a simple `duration`-based heuristic (like Gen 34's `cost - 0.4*duration`) is more efficient.

## Implementation Insights
- **Pre-Sprint Candidate Sorting:** A critical implementation detail in **Gen 34** is `candidates_pool.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` executed *before* the Sprint phase. This ensures that the expensive optimization logic is strictly applied to the mathematically best seeds. Lower-scoring programs in this batch often applied "funnels" to diverse but unsorted pools, wasting cycles refining poor candidates.
- **Specific Block Move Size Constraints:** The **Current Best Program** restricts block moves to a very small window: `block_size = random.randint(2, 4)`. This specific constraint allows the scheduler to move dependent chains of transactions without disrupting the global structure. Programs that leave block sizes unconstrained or dynamic often struggle to find valid insertion points for large blocks.
- **Fixed vs. Adaptive Mutation Rates:** **Gen 34** uses hardcoded probabilities (0.6/0.3/0.1) which proved more stable than the adaptive schemes attempted in **Gen 65** or the mixed strategies in **Gen 60**. The stability of the operator distribution allows the LAHC history mechanism to function correctly without the interference of changing neighborhood definitions.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "3.60" Complexity Barrier:** No program in Generations 60-69 was able to beat the **Gen 34 (Score: 3.62)** benchmark. The highest scores in this batch (**Gen 60, 65, 68**) all hit a hard ceiling at **3.55**. This indicates that increasing algorithmic complexity (extra funnel stages, smart mutations, hotness calculations) yields diminishing returns compared to the raw search depth enabled by Gen 34's streamlined logic.
- **Search Depth vs. Breadth:** The data confirms a direct correlation between iteration count on the final candidate and score. **Gen 34** dedicates 2500 iterations to the single winner. Programs like **Gen 61** and **Gen 63** (Score: 3.36) likely failed because their "hierarchical refinement" spread the computational budget too thin across too many candidates or stages, resulting in shallow local optima.
- **Convergence of Approaches:** There is a tight clustering of scores around 3.52-3.55 for well-implemented but complex solutions (**Gen 60, 62, 64, 65, 68**). This suggests that 3.55 is the local optimum for "smart" heuristics, while 3.62 represents the gain achieved by stripping away that overhead to maximize simple, randomized hill-climbing iterations.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program (Generation 34)** and the global insights from Generations 60-69, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Diversity-Driven Parameter Randomization**: While strictly preserving the first candidate as the fixed baseline (`alpha=0.4`, `threshold=0.9`), modify the greedy loop for subsequent candidates to sample `alpha` from `[0.2, 0.6]` and the Big Rock threshold from `[0.85, 0.95]`. This creates structural diversity in the initial pool, increasing the likelihood of finding a schedule topology that refines better than the single fixed heuristic.
2.  **Integrate Stagnation-Based Perturbation ("Kick")**: Enhance the "Marathon" phase by tracking the number of iterations since the last global improvement. If the score stagnates for a specific window (e.g., 500 iterations), apply a "kick"—a forced move of a larger block (size 6-10) or a sequence of multiple random mutations without acceptance checks—to dislodge the search from the local optimum responsible for the 3.62 score ceiling.
3.  **Deploy Multi-Scale Block Mutations**: Refine the operator distribution by splitting the successful "Block Insert" into two distinct tiers: maintain the high-frequency "Micro-Block" (size 2-4, ~25% prob) for local polishing, and introduce a low-frequency "Macro-Block" (size 5-8, ~5% prob). This allows the algorithm to occasionally relocate larger chains of dependent transactions that cannot be optimized by small, local moves.
4.  **Enforce Late-Stage Pure Descent**: Modify the LAHC loop in the Marathon phase to ignore the history list and enforce strict Hill Climbing (only accept `new_cost < current_cost`) during the final 20% of the iteration budget. This acts as a "cooling" phase, ensuring the final schedule settles at the true bottom of the basin of attraction and
