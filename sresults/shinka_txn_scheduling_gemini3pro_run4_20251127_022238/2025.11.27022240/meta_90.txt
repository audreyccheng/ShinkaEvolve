# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 80-89, the previous insights, and the source code of the new **Current Best Program (Generation 81, Score: 3.64)**, here are the detailed optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Decaying Alpha Greedy Initialization:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 81, Score: 3.64)** and **Generation 87 (Score: 3.61)** significantly outperformed others by utilizing a linear decay on the length-weighting parameter (`alpha`). Unlike static "Big Rocks" heuristics, this approach prioritizes long transactions heavily at the start (to mask latency) and gradually transitions to prioritizing "best fit" (tight packing) as the schedule fills. This dynamic heuristic proved superior to the static weights used in previous generations.
- **Integrated Terminal Cooling:** A decisive factor in breaking the 3.62 ceiling was the introduction of a "Cooling Phase" within the LAHC loop. **Gen 81** implements a strict hill-climbing constraint for the final 20% of iterations (`is_cooling = i > (iterations * 0.8)`). This prevents the algorithm from terminating in a sub-optimal state allowed by the LAHC history list, forcing it to converge to the nearest local minimum before finishing.
- **Multi-Scale Block Mutations:** While previous insights identified block size 2-4 as optimal, **Gen 81** and **Gen 87** refined this by explicitly distinguishing between **Micro-Block** (size 2-4, 25% probability) and **Macro-Block** (size 5-10, 6% probability) moves. This tiered approach allows the algorithm to perform frequent local repairs while retaining the ability to restructure larger dependency chains without the destructiveness of random large block moves.
- **Sprint/Marathon Architecture:** The two-phase refinement strategy (Sprint on top 3, Marathon on top 1) remains the dominant structural pattern. **Gen 81** and **Gen 86 (Score: 3.60)** utilized this efficiently, whereas **Generation 80 (Score: 3.55)** demonstrated that using a three-stage "Expanded Funnel" diluted computational resources across too many candidates, resulting in a lower score.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Static "Big Rocks" Heuristics:** Programs like **Generation 84 (Score: 3.46)** used "Big Rocks" initialization but seemingly without the aggressive decay curve or terminal cooling found in the top performers. The failure to reach >3.55 suggests that static prioritization of transaction length causes bottlenecks mid-schedule that basic local search cannot easily resolve within the time limit.
- **Complex "Conflict-Aware" Logic:** While **Generation 86 (Score: 3.60)** performed well, it did not beat the simpler length-based heuristic of Gen 81. The added complexity of calculating conflict scores likely consumed setup time that yielded diminishing returns compared to the raw throughput of the simpler "Decaying Length" heuristic.
- **Unconstrained LAHC Termination:** Earlier generations and lower performers in this batch (e.g., **Gen 82, Score: 3.50**) allowed the LAHC algorithm to terminate naturally. Without the "Cooling" phase used in Gen 81, these algorithms often drift away from the best-found solution in the final iterations due to the permissive nature of the Late Acceptance criterion.

## Implementation Insights
- **Linear Decay Formula:** The **Current Best Program (Gen 81)** implements the decaying heuristic with the specific formula: `eff_alpha = current_alpha * (1.0 - (0.8 * progress))`. This reduces the influence of transaction length by 80% by the end of construction, smoothly shifting the strategy from "latency masking" to "gap filling."
- **Tiered Operator Probabilities:** **Gen 81** uses a sophisticated, hardcoded probability distribution for mutations: **4% Sampled Best-Fit** (high computational cost, high reward), **25% Micro-Block**, **6% Macro-Block**, and **65% Single Shift/Swap**. This structure minimizes the impact of expensive operators while maintaining high traversal speed with cheap operators.
- **Strict Pre-Optimization Sorting:** Consistent with previous bests, **Gen 81** sorts candidates by cost *before* entering the expensive refinement phases (`candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`). This ensures that the "Sprint" iterations are dedicated strictly to the mathematically most promising seeds, preventing resource waste on suboptimal greedy candidates.
- **In-Loop Cooling Logic:** Rather than a separate function, **Gen 81** integrates cooling directly into the main loop via a boolean flag (`is_cooling`). This implementation detail avoids the overhead of restarting the search context or rebuilding history lists, allowing for a seamless transition from exploration (LAHC) to exploitation (Hill Climbing).

## Performance Analysis
- **Breaking the 3.62 Ceiling:** The progression from the previous best (Gen 34, 3.62) to the **new best (Gen 81, 3.64)** highlights the value of the "Cooling" and "Decay" mechanisms. While 0.02 seems small, in this

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generation 81 and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Time-Varying Mutation Probabilities**: Build upon the successful "Decaying Alpha" concept by applying a similar decay logic to the mutation operators in the LAHC loop. Start with higher probabilities for disruptive moves like "Macro-Block Shift" (size 5-10) and "Sampled Best-Fit" early in the search to maximize exploration, and linearly decay their probabilities to near-zero in favor of "Single Shift/Swap" by the time the "Cooling Phase" begins.

2.  **Adopt Non-Linear Heuristic Decay**: Refine the greedy construction phase by introducing a randomized exponent to the decay formula: `eff_alpha = current_alpha * ((1.0 - progress) ** decay_power)`. Sample `decay_power` from a range (e.g., `[0.5, 2.0]`) for each candidate. This creates diversity in how quickly the algorithm switches from "Big Rocks" (latency masking) to "Sand" (gap filling), potentially finding a superior curve to the current linear (`power=1`) approach.

3.  **Upgrade Stagnation Recovery to "Ruin & Recreate"**: Enhance the current "Stagnation Kick" (which currently just shuffles a segment) by implementing a partial reconstruction. When stagnation is detected, remove a block of 10-15 transactions and re-insert them one by one using the `get_opt_seq_cost` greedy logic. This allows the algorithm to aggressively break out of local optima while immediately repairing the damage using known good heuristics.

4.  **Integrate a "Block Reversal" Operator**: Expand the successful "Multi-Scale Block" pattern by adding a **Block Reversal** mutation (probability ~5%, size 3-6). While shifts relocate dependency chains, they cannot fix chains that are internally ordered inefficiently (e.g., reverse dependency order). This operator specifically targets and untangles these local inversions.

5.  **Refine Cooling with Dynamic History Compression**: Instead of a hard binary switch to Hill Climbing at 80% progress, linearly decrease the LAHC `history_len` from its maximum (e.g., 150) down to 0 over the duration of the Marathon phase. This creates a "Simulated Annealing"-like tightening of the acceptance criterion, guiding the search smoothly toward a local minimum before the final strict cooling phase locks it in.
