<DESCRIPTION>
I am replacing the sampled beam search with a fully exhaustive beam search to ensure high-quality construction. Sampling candidates is detrimental for scheduling problems where specific dependencies dictate the optimal order.
I am also enhancing the Simulated Annealing phase by adding a "Block Move" operator (moving contiguous subsequences) alongside Insert and Swap. This allows the algorithm to re-position clusters of related transactions without breaking their internal structure.
I increased the SA iterations to 8000 to leverage the efficient construction phase, and added a reheating mechanism to escape local optima.
