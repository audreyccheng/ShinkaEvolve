# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the detailed analysis of **Generations 70-79** and the continued dominance of the current best program (**Generation 62**, Score 4.44), here are the updated optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Quadratic Efficiency Construction + LPT Polish (The "Golden Combination"):** The significant performance gap between the current best **Generation 62** (Score: 4.44) and the strong runner-ups like **Generation 73** and **Generation 76** (Score: 4.29) is attributed to combining a *Quadratic Efficiency Bonus* during Beam Search with a strict *LPT-Ordered* deterministic polish. While Gen 73 used quadratic bonuses, and Gen 71 used LPT polish, only Gen 62 effectively combined both to maximize initial packing density and then stabilize it with "Big Rocks First" refinement.
- **Deterministic Gap Repair with Early Exit:** Programs that utilized a deterministic, iterative "Gap Repair" strategy consistently outscored stochastic approaches. **Generation 73** (Score: 4.29) and **Generation 76** (Score: 4.29) demonstrated that iteratively re-inserting transactions to minimize gaps is highly effective. The "early exit" optimization (stopping the search when cost increase is zero) allowed these programs to perform deep searches without timing out, a technique perfected in **Generation 62**.
- **Alternating Polish Order:** **Generation 79** (Score: 4.27) introduced an alternating polish strategy (LPT vs. Reverse). While it did not beat Gen 62, it matched the performance of standard LPT approaches (Gen 71), suggesting that varying the sort order during refinement is a viable strategy to escape local optima, provided the primary sort remains LPT.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Simulated Annealing (SA) Reintroduction:** The evaluation results for **Generations 70-79** definitively confirm that Simulated Annealing is inferior for this specific packing problem. **Generation 72** (Score: 4.13), **Generation 74** (Score: 4.05), and **Generation 75** (Score: 4.18) all reintroduced SA in various forms (Hybrid, Multi-segment) and consistently failed to break the 4.20 barrier. The stochastic nature of SA disrupts the tight "Tetris-like" packing required for optimal makespans.
- **Overly Complex Refinement Logic:** **Generation 77** attempted a "Deep Convergent Polish" with complex iterative modifications and failed validation (Score: 0.0). This highlights that while deep polish is necessary, the logic must remain simple and robust (like the greedy best-fit in Gen 62) to avoid invalid permutations or runtime errors.
- **Linear Heuristics without "Big Rocks" Prioritization:** **Generation 70** (Score: 4.27) used a dynamic work-density heuristic but lacked the specific quadratic bonus of Gen 62. While effective, it hit a "glass ceiling" at 4.27, unable to find the hyper-optimized 4.44 solution, proving that linear rewards are insufficient for identifying perfect parallelism during construction.

## Implementation Insights
- **Quadratic Efficiency Mathematics:** The specific implementation in **Generation 62** that drives its success is the non-linear reward function. By using `efficiency = max(0.0, (t_len - delta) / t_len)` and calculating `bonus = t_len * 3.0 * (efficiency ** 2)`, the algorithm disproportionately rewards "perfect fits" (where efficiency is near 1.0) over "good fits." This steers the beam search toward structural layouts that are harder to achieve via random mutation.
- **Optimized Polish Loop Construction:** The most effective polish phase (seen in **Generation 62** and partially in **Generation 78**) follows a strict pattern:
  1. **Sort** transactions by LPT (Longest Processing Time).
  2. **Remove** transaction $T$.
  3. **Scan** all positions $P$.
  4. **Early Exit** if `cost(P) == cost_without_T` (Perfect Parallelism).
  This structure allows the algorithm to perform an $O(N^2)$ refinement pass extremely fast, enabling multiple iterations within the time limit.
- **Gamma Decay vs. Static Weights:** Successful programs (Gen 62, 70, 78) employ a decaying `Gamma` factor (e.g., 1.8 down to 1.0) in the construction phase. This shifts the focus from "pure parallelism" at the start (building width) to "tight packing" at the end (filling gaps), mimicking the physical packing of objects.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Deterministic Plateau" vs. The Peak:** There is a clear performance plateau between **4.27** and **4.29** for well-written deterministic algorithms (Generations 70, 71, 73, 76, 79). To break this plateau and reach the **4.44** achieved by **Generation 62**, the algorithm requires the specific synergy of *Quadratic Construction* (to seed the schedule correctly) and *LPT Refinement* (to compact it). Neither technique alone is sufficient to bridge this gap.
- **Stochastic Penalty:** Programs relying on Simulated Annealing (Gen 72, 74, 75) consistently suffer a ~0.25 to ~0.40 point penalty compared to the best deterministic approach. The variance in SA scores indicates it occasionally finds good local minima but lacks the systematic convergence of the Gap Repair method.
- **Consistency of LPT:** Across Generational 71, 72, 74, 75, and 79, the presence of LPT (Longest Processing Time) ordering in the polish or repair phase is a constant factor in programs that score above 4.0. It is statistically the most reliable heuristic for schedule stability.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of **Generation 62** (Score: 4.44) and the demonstrated success of deterministic LPT-ordered optimization, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Maximize Polish Convergence via Unbounded Passes**
    The current "Early Exit" optimization (breaking when cost increase is zero) makes the polish passes extremely efficient. **Recommendation:** Significantly increase or remove the `MAX_PASSES` limit (e.g., set to 20 or `while improved`) in the refinement phase. This allows the LPT-ordered "Big Rocks" strategy to run until the schedule strictly settles into a local minimum, squeezing out marginal gains that a shallow search misses.

2.  **Implement Alternating Polish Ordering (LPT/SPT)**
    While LPT (Longest Processing Time) is the most effective primary sort, it can lock the schedule into a specific structure. **Recommendation:** Modify the polish loop to alternate the sorting order of transactions being checked. Use LPT for odd passes to stabilize large items, and SPT (Smallest Processing Time) for even passes to optimally fit small "sand" transactions into the gaps created by the large items, breaking LPT-specific local optima.

3.  **Enforce Left-Biased Tie-Breaking**
    The current algorithm selects the first position found or strictly better positions. **Recommendation:** In the "Gap Repair" loop, if a candidate position yields a global cost *equal* to the current best (`new_cost == best_cost`), explicitly prefer the position that results in the **earliest completion time** for that specific transaction. This "Left-Packing" bias reduces internal fragmentation without increasing makespan, potentially opening up space at the end of the schedule for subsequent moves.

4.  **Adaptive Quadratic Efficiency Bonus**
    The static factor `3.0` in the quadratic reward `bonus = t_len * 3.0 * (efficiency ** 2)` drives the current program's success. **Recommendation:** Make this coefficient dynamic during the Constructive Beam Search. Start with a higher weight (e.g., 5.0) to aggressively force wide, parallel structures in the early stages, and decay it linearly to a lower value (e.g., 1.0) towards the end to prioritize simple gap-filling over complex structural changes.

5.  **Efficiency-Targeted Ruin Strategy**
    Current ruin modes (Block, Random, Tail) are structure-agnostic. **Recommendation:** Introduce a new "Smart Ruin" mode in the ILS phase that targets "inefficient" transactions. Calculate the local cost contribution (marginal cost) of each transaction; remove and re-insert the top $N$ transactions that cause the largest jumps in the makespan. This specifically targets the "bottlenecks" in the schedule rather than disrupting well-packed sections.
