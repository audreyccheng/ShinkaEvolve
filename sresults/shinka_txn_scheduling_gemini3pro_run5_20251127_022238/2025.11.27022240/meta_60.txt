# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the evaluation results of **Generations 50-59** and the detailed analysis of the current best program (**Generation 57**, Score 4.29), here are the updated insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Exhaustive Deterministic "Gap Repair" Polish:** The most significant breakthrough in this batch is the introduction of a systematic "Gap Repair" phase. **Generation 53** (Score: 4.27), **Generation 57** (Score: 4.29), and **Generation 59** (Score: 4.29) all utilize a deterministic post-processing step that removes every transaction and re-inserts it at the optimal position. This pushed scores from the previous ceiling of ~4.07 to nearly 4.30.
- **Synergy of Zero-Cost Beam and Deterministic Polish:** The top-performing **Generation 57** combines the "Zero-Cost Bonus" beam search construction (proven in Gen 35) with the new "Gap Repair" polish. The construction creates a dense, parallelism-optimized structure, which the polish step then systematically tightens, resolving dependencies that stochastic methods miss.
- **LPT-Ordered Reinsertion:** **Generation 59** (Score: 4.29) and **Generation 57** explicitly sort removed transactions by Longest Processing Time (LPT) before re-inserting them during the repair phase. This "Big Rocks First" approach prevents schedule fragmentation, significantly outperforming random reinsertion order.
- **Multi-Mode Ruin Strategies:** The best programs continue to use a mix of ruin modes. **Generation 57** employs a specific probability distribution: 25% Tail Ruin (critical path), 35% Single Block (locality), and 40% Disjoint Blocks (global shuffle). This diversity is essential for escaping local optima before the deterministic polish is applied.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Pure Simulated Annealing (SA) Refinement:** **Generation 50** (Score: 3.97) relied on Adaptive SA for optimization. Despite a decent score, it failed to break the 4.00 barrier, confirming that stochastic acceptance criteria are less effective than greedy, exhaustive "Best-Fit" strategies for tightening transaction schedules.
- **Tail-Targeted Ruin Without Polish:** **Generation 51** (Score: 3.75) focused heavily on "Tail-Targeted" ruin but lacked the exhaustive gap repair or the zero-cost beam bonus. The significantly lower score indicates that focusing solely on the end of the schedule is insufficient; global structural optimization is required.
- **Standard Repair Without Exhaustive Polish:** Programs like **Generation 52** (Score: 3.91) and **Generation 54** (Score: 3.98) used LPT repair but missed the exhaustive "Gap Repair" pass. While robust, they consistently underperformed the >4.20 tier, highlighting that the computational cost of the exhaustive polish is necessary for top-tier results.

## Implementation Insights
- **The "Gap Repair" Logic:** The defining feature of the >4.20 programs (e.g., **Generation 57**) is a nested loop structure in the polish phase. It iterates through a snapshot of the schedule, temporarily removes a transaction, and scans *all* possible insertion points:
  ```python
  for txn in list(current_schedule):
      del current_schedule[current_idx]
      for pos in range(len(current_schedule) + 1):
          # Check cost at pos...
      # Insert at best_pos
  ```
  This $O(N^2)$ operation is computationally expensive but yields the final ~5% efficiency gain.
- **Zero-Cost Bonus Implementation:** **Generation 57** retains the critical beam search heuristic:
  ```python
  if new_cost <= parent_cost + 1e-6:
      new_score -= (txn_lengths[t] * 2.5)
  ```
  This forces the beam search to prioritize perfect parallelism immediately, creating a high-quality backbone for the ILS to refine.
- **LPT Sort in Repair:** In the ILS loop, the best programs explicitly sort the transactions to be re-inserted:
  ```python
  removed_txns.sort(key=lambda t: txn_lengths.get(t, 0), reverse=True)
  ```
  This ensures that large transactions are placed into optimal gaps first, while smaller transactions fill the remaining spaces.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 4.20 Breakout:** A distinct performance tier has emerged. While previous bests plateaued at ~4.07, the introduction of the deterministic "Gap Repair" polish (Gen 53, 57, 58, 59) has elevated scores to the **4.22 - 4.29** range. This suggests that the solution space has "tight" optima that are accessible only via systematic, non-stochastic refinement.
- **Dominance of Determinism:** The data clearly favors deterministic, exhaustive local search over stochastic methods. The top three programs (Gen 53, 57, 59) all rely on exhaustive greedy moves ("Best-Fit" insertion and "Gap Repair") rather than probabilistic swaps (SA).
- **Initialization Matters:** Despite the powerful repair mechanism, the initialization phase remains critical. **Generation 57** (Beam Search with Zero-Cost Bonus) tied for the top score, suggesting that starting with a "parallelism-aware" schedule allows the "Gap Repair" polish to reach a better global optimum than starting from a generic LPT or random schedule.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generation 57 (Score 4.29) and the "Gap Repair" breakthrough, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations. These recommendations focus on maximizing the effectiveness of the deterministic polish phase and enhancing the constructive heuristics.

1.  **Enforce Convergence in Gap Repair**
    Modify the deterministic polish phase to run until convergence (or a higher limit, e.g., 5 passes) rather than stopping after a single pass (`MAX_PASSES = 1`). Since the "Gap Repair" logic is the primary driver of the recent score jump (~4.07 to 4.29), allowing it to iteratively refine the schedule until no further transactions can be moved will squeeze out the final inefficiencies that a single pass misses.

2.  **Prioritize LPT Sort in Polish Iteration**
    Change the iteration order within the polish loop to process transactions by **Longest Processing Time (LPT) descending**, rather than their current position in the schedule. By attempting to optimize the placement of the largest transactions ("big rocks") first, the algorithm can establish a robust structural skeleton, allowing smaller transactions to fit into the remaining gaps more effectively during the same pass.

3.  **Implement One-Step Lookahead in Beam Search**
    Enhance the Beam Search constructive phase by adding a lookahead mechanism for high-scoring candidates. When the top candidates are separated by a negligible margin (e.g., < 1%), simulate the addition of the *next* best transaction for each. Prioritize the branch that minimizes the cumulative cost of both steps, preventing greedy choices that immediately block parallelism for subsequent transactions.

4.  **Allow "Sideways" Moves in Polish**
    Relax the acceptance criterion in the Gap Repair phase to accept moves that yield an *equal* makespan (`new_cost <= current_cost` instead of strict `<`). This allows the algorithm to traverse plateaus in the solution landscape, repositioning transactions to structurally different but cost-equivalent slots that may unlock new optimization opportunities in subsequent iterations or for neighboring transactions.

5.  **Implement Adaptive Ruin Intensity**
    Replace the static ruin sizes with a dynamic "Temperature" parameter that adjusts based on search stagnation. If the global `best_cost` has not improved for several ILS cycles, progressively increase the size of the removed blocks (e.g., scaling from 20% to 50% of the schedule). This allows the program to make fine-grained adjustments when refining a good solution but aggressive structural changes when trapped in a local optimum.
