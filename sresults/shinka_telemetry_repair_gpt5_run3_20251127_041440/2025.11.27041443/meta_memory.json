  "meta_scratch_pad": "## Successful Algorithmic Patterns\n- Hybrid Hodor pattern (current best): adaptive per-link fusion + conservative, confidence-weighted router projection + gentle re-sync consistently yields top scores. The current best program \u201cHybrid Hodor repair: robust link hardening with adaptive fusion + conservative router projection\u201d achieves Combined 0.94 (counter 0.936, status 1.000, confidence 0.942). It uses tau_h_dir 1.5\u20133%, tau_router(n)=0.05*sqrt(2/max(2,n)) clamped [0.03,0.07], two-tier scaling with 0.90 lower bound and clip highs 1.12/1.10, uniform damping 0.4, and re-sync of the lower-confidence side only. Peers with the same pattern (Gen 90/91/92/94/97/99) match Combined 0.94 with counter \u22480.935\u20130.937 and confidence \u22480.933\u20130.942.\n- Dominance/expected-penalty side selection with caps prevents overshoot while closing router residuals. Current best and Gen 91/94/97 select the lower-confidence side, use weights proportional to (1-conf)*rate, and cap per-interface changes (dominance-aware), producing perfect status and high counter accuracy (0.936\u20130.937).\n- Targeted post-projection re-sync improves link symmetry without breaking conservation. Current best and Gen 90/91/94 adjust only the lower-confidence direction, gate by router imbalance, and keep small factors; this tightens directional agreement and contributes to stable confidence (\u22650.942).\n- Confidence calibrated to actions and invariants is crucial. Current best blends pre/post mismatches, change magnitude, router imbalance, scale/clipping penalties, stability and bundle-consistency, plus peer smoothing, reaching 0.942. Gen 98 pushes calibration to 0.945 by adding router/peer smoothing and scaling guards while keeping counter 0.935.\n\n## Ineffective Approaches\n- Global/iterative POCS projections underperform on both counter and confidence. Gen 95 (\u201cglobal_weighted_pocs\u201d, Combined 0.83; counter 0.837; confidence 0.785) and Gen 96 (\u201cglobal_pocs_projection\u201d, Combined 0.66; counter 0.653; confidence 0.617) show that alternating projections with generic WLS, even with HHI-aware caps and non-negativity damping, leave residual imbalances and decouple confidence from actual invariant improvements.\n- Overly conservative consensus/bundle caps cap performance. Gen 93 (\u201ctwo_pass_micro_resync_and_router_residual_fix\u201d, Combined 0.94; counter 0.931; confidence 0.934) uses guarded, bundle-aware scaling with adaptive clipping/guards; feedback flags hyperparameter sensitivity and residual imbalances\u2014consistent with the broader observation that strict per-link/bundle caps plateau counter \u22480.925\u20130.931.\n- Simpler or linear residual-only confidence mappings limit calibration. POCS variants relying on linear blends and modest smoothing settle at confidence 0.617\u20130.785, versus \u22650.936 when confidence is tied to post-projection invariants, scale magnitude, and clip-hit penalties (current best; Gen 91/92/94/98).\n\n## Implementation Insights\n- What makes the current best effective:\n  - Adaptive tolerances at both link and router levels closely match prior winning settings: tau_h_dir returns 1.5\u20133% based on rate/confidence; tau_router(n) follows 0.05*sqrt(2/max(2,n)) within [0.03, 0.07]. This suppresses low-rate jitter yet doesn\u2019t hide true imbalance (mirrors Gen 90/91/92/94).\n  - Confidence-weighted, tiered scaling with strict bounds and dominance caps: two tiers (<0.70 to 1.12; 0.70\u20130.85 to 1.10) with a 0.90 floor, weights proportional to (1-conf)*rate, per-interface dominance cap (\u226450% of remaining delta), followed by a uniformly damped step (alpha_eff with 0.4 damping). This exact structure also appears in Gen 91/94/97 and underpins counter 0.936\u20130.937 without overshoot.\n  - Re-sync is surgical and conservation-aware: adjust only the lower-confidence side; scale by confidence gap up to 0.4 and attenuate by router imbalance; avoid re-sync on strongly scaled directions (strong_scaled flags). This protects router totals while closing residual asymmetries.\n  - Confidence integrates what actually happened: base link confidence, pre/post mismatch reduction, router post-imbalance penalty, scale magnitude and clip-hit penalties, stability/share, bundle-consistency, plus final symmetry and peer smoothing (10%). This yields calibration 0.942 in the current best; Gen 98\u2019s router/peer smoothing and scaling guards push calibration to 0.945 with similar counter.\n- Soft-zero handling is conditional and topology-aware: the current best snaps tiny links to zero only if both adjacent routers are within their adaptive tau_router, preventing zeroing that would worsen conservation (also reflected in Gen 98\u2019s \u201cstrict soft-zero handling\u201d).\n\n## Performance Analysis\n- The 0.94 cluster is robust; differences are in counter and confidence tightness:\n  - Current best: 0.94 (counter 0.936; confidence 0.942). Gen 94 matches (0.936; 0.942) with median-based bundle alignment; Gen 99 yields slightly higher counter 0.937 but lower calibration 0.935; Gen 98 reaches the best calibration 0.945 with counter 0.935. This indicates a small trade-off band between counter gains and confidence calibration depending on scaling guards and finishing choices.\n  - Bundle-aware consensus variants that lean on shared-factor scaling and strict caps remain slightly behind on counter (Gen 93: 0.931; Gen 98 better at 0.935 after adding router-biased fusion and scaling guards), confirming that hybrid Hodor\u2019s targeted scaling plus re-sync closes residuals more reliably.\n- POCS-family approaches trail significantly: Gen 95 at Combined 0.83 (counter 0.837; confidence 0.785) and Gen 96 at 0.66 (counter 0.653; confidence 0.617) validate that alternating/global projections with generic WLS and light smoothing under-correct large asymmetries and miscalibrate confidence versus invariant satisfaction.\n- Status repair is saturated at 1.000 across top methods; thus overall ranking is determined by counter and especially confidence calibration. Programs incorporating clip-hit/scale penalties and peer/router smoothing (current best; Gen 91/92/94/98) consistently achieve calibration \u22650.933, with the top around 0.942\u20130.945, while more conservative consensus pipelines sit around 0.934 and POCS variants fall well below.",
  "meta_recommendations": "1. Replace side selection with expected-penalty scoring and add a 70/30 split on near ties\n   - For each router, compute S_tx = \u03a3_i (1 \u2212 conf_tx[i])\u00b7tx[i] and S_rx = \u03a3_i (1 \u2212 conf_rx[i])\u00b7rx[i]; pick the side with the larger S_side to adjust. If |S_tx \u2212 S_rx|/max(S_tx, S_rx) \u2264 0.10, apply 70% of the residual on the lower-penalty side, recompute, then apply the remaining 30% on the other side, keeping existing dominance caps, tier clips (1.12/1.10), and near-zero shielding. This preserves the current dominance-aware pattern but reduces concentration and clip hits in borderline cases.\n\n2. Make bounds share- and dominance-aware and distribute the final uniform step by slack\n   - Replace the fixed 0.90 floor with lb_i = min(0.97, 0.90 + 0.05\u00b7sqrt(HHI_router) + 0.05\u00b7share_i), and use lb_i across both tiers and the uniform step; keep clip highs at 1.12 (low-conf) and 1.10 (mid-conf). In the final damped pass, distribute alpha via weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7(1 \u2212 share_i), applying alpha_i = 1 + 0.4\u00b7(alpha \u2212 1)\u00b7w_i/\u03a3w and capping per-interface alpha_i to [0.97, 1.03]. This protects dominant links while letting slack, low-confidence members absorb more correction, improving counter accuracy without overshoot.\n\n3. Bias Stage 1 fusion toward router conservation in large mismatches\n   - In fuse_direction\u2019s large-mismatch branch, nudge toward the side that reduces router residuals: fused = avg + \u03b2\u00b7(target_side \u2212 avg), avg = 0.5\u00b7(v_local + v_peer), with \u03b2 = min(0.4, 0.5\u00b7(((imb_a + imb_b)/tau_avg) \u2212 1)+), where imb_r is rel_diff(\u03a3tx_r, \u03a3rx_r) and tau_avg is the mean tau_router of the two routers. Retain the current status/near-zero shields and snap-to-peer rules when one end is near-zero or down. This moves conservation earlier, easing Stage 2 while keeping link asymmetries where routers are already balanced.\n\n4. Add a second, saturating re-sync micro-pass gated by tolerance and router balance\n   - After the existing re-sync, identify link-directions with residual > 1.5\u00d7 tau_h_dir and with both adjacent routers within their tau_router; run a second pass with halved gain and tight caps: f2 = 0.5\u00b7f_gain\u00b7min(0.20, gap",
  "meta_recommendations_history": [
    "1. Targeted router correction on outliers instead of uniform scaling\n   - Keep the conservative router projection, but when a router is imbalanced, adjust only the lowest-confidence, non-trivial interfaces on the chosen side. Compute weights w_i = (1 - conf_side[i]) * max(rate_i, ZERO_THRESH) for active interfaces, allocate the correction proportionally, and apply per-interface clipped scaling in [0.90, 1.10] with the same 60% damping used today. This preserves the proven router-flow conservation while reducing unnecessary changes on high-confidence links, which should lift both counter accuracy and confidence calibration.\n\n2. Bundle-aware scaling for parallel links between the same router pair\n   - When multiple interfaces connect the same local_router and remote_router, form a bundle group and, if that group contributes the majority of the router\u2019s traffic on the adjusted side, apply a shared alpha_eff to the group (still clipped 0.85\u20131.15 and damped 60%) rather than per-link scaling. This leverages topology context like the current best program but adds consistency across parallel links, reducing residual asymmetry and the burden on Stage 2.5 re-sync.\n\n3. Confidence-gap-proportional post-projection re-sync with scaling guard\n   - Replace the fixed 50% nudge toward the mean with a confidence-gap-weighted nudge: move the lower-confidence side by fraction f = min(0.4, max(0.0, conf_high - conf_low)) toward the pair mean, and only when rel_diff exceeds TAU_H and both sides exceed ZERO_THRESH. Additionally, skip re-sync on a direction that just received a strong router scaling (e.g., |scale_factor - 1| > 0.08) to avoid double-adjustment. This keeps the \u201cgentle and one-sided\u201d benefit while further reducing overcorrection.\n\n4. Confidence calibration: explicit scale-penalty and peer smoothing\n   - Add a scale-factor term to the final confidence: include 0.10 weight on scale_factor_term = clamp01(1.0 - min(0.5, |alpha_eff_side - 1.0|)) using the stored scaled_tx_factor/scaled_rx_factor. Then softly harmonize per-direction confidences across peers with a 10% blend: conf_dir[i] = 0.90 * conf_dir[i] + 0.10 * conf_dir[peer_opposite], applied only when both ends are up. This builds on the existing multi-factor blend and the 70/30 residual touch-up to further align confidence with actual adjustment magnitude and symmetry.\n\n5. Adaptive tolerances and near-zero handling to reduce noise-driven adjustments\n   - Make TAU_H tiered: use 0.015 when both sides > 100 Mbps and both confidences \u2265 0.8, 0.02 baseline, and 0.03 when either side < 1 Mbps or confidence < 0.7 (to avoid jitter at low rates). Set TAU_ROUTER adaptively with n_active = count of interfaces with rate \u2265 ZERO_THRESH: TAU_ROUTER = clamp(0.03, 0.07, 0.05 * sqrt(2 / max(2, n_active))). Finally, add a soft-zero rule: if both directions of a link are < 2*ZERO_THRESH and there\u2019s no strong contradictory evidence (both ends up with high confidence), snap both to 0 with high confidence to stabilize near-zero noise.",
    "1. Two-tier, targeted router scaling with dominance cap\n   - When a router is imbalanced, first allocate correction only to low-confidence, active interfaces (conf < 0.70) using weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i) * max(rate_i, ZERO_THRESH), with per-interface scale_i = clip(1 + 0.6 * k * w_i, 0.90\u20131.12). If residual imbalance remains > 0.5*TAU_ROUTER, spill over to a second tier (0.70 \u2264 conf < 0.85) using the same formula but clipped to 0.90\u20131.10. Cap any single interface\u2019s share of the total correction to \u226450% and redistribute the remainder to prevent over-reliance on one link, preserving calibration while closing counter gaps.\n\n2. Bundle-aware group scaling with intra-bundle smoothing\n   - Detect parallel-link bundles by grouping interfaces with the same (local_router, remote_router). If a bundle contributes \u226560% of the adjusted side\u2019s traffic on that router, compute a shared alpha_eff = 1 + 0.6*(clip(0.85\u20131.15, target/current) \u2212 1) for the group, then apply a small intra-bundle rebalance pass using \u00b15% per-link clipping weighted by (1 \u2212 conf)*rate. This aligns with the proven router projection and reduces residual asymmetry across parallel links, easing the load on post-projection re-sync.\n\n3. Confidence-gap re-sync with scaling guard and router-imbalance attenuation\n   - Keep the one-sided nudge, but skip re-sync on a direction that just had strong scaling: if |scaled_{tx/rx}_factor \u2212 1| > 0.08 on that side, do not nudge it in this cycle. Otherwise, use f = min(0.4, max(0, conf_high \u2212 conf_low)) and attenuate by local router imbalance: f *= clamp01(1 \u2212 router_imbalance(local_router)), then move only the lower-confidence side toward the mean by fraction f; when both sides have low confidence (<0.7), apply a cautious symmetric nudge f \u2248 0.10\u20130.15. This avoids double-adjusting recently scaled links and preserves router conservation while reducing post-mismatch.\n\n4. Adaptive tolerances and soft-zero stabilization\n   - Make TAU_H tiered: 0.015 when both sides > 100 Mbps and both confidences \u2265 0.8; 0.02 baseline; 0.03 when either side < 1 Mbps or confidence < 0.7 to suppress low-rate jitter. Set TAU_ROUTER adaptively based on active interfaces n_active: TAU_ROUTER = clip(0.03, 0.07, 0.05 * sqrt(2 / max(2, n_active))). Add a soft-zero rule: if both directions on a link are < 2*ZERO_THRESH and neither adjacent router shows imbalance > TAU_ROUTER, snap both to 0 with high confidence, reinforcing the current best\u2019s near-zero handling.\n\n5. Confidence calibration refinements: peer smoothing, clip-hit penalty, untouched boost\n   - Keep the existing multi-factor blend and 70/30 residual touch-up, then add a 10% peer smoothing: conf_dir = 0.90*conf_dir + 0.10*conf_peer_opposite when both ends are up. Apply a mild clip-hit penalty: if a direction\u2019s scaling was clipped (reached 0.90 or 1.10) or |scale_factor \u2212 1| \u2265 0.10, multiply its confidence by 0.95; conversely, if a direction changed < 1% across all stages and final symmetry is good (residual < TAU_H), boost confidence by +0.02 up to 0.98. These tweaks align confidence more tightly with actual adjustment magnitude and final agreement, matching patterns seen in the top-tier programs.",
    "1. Add bundle-aware router scaling with intra-bundle smoothing\n   - Detect parallel-link bundles by grouping interfaces with the same (local_router, remote_router). When a bundle contributes \u226560% of the adjusted side\u2019s traffic on a router, apply a shared alpha_eff = 1 + 0.6*(clip[0.85, 1.15](target/current) \u2212 1) to the whole bundle, then run a small intra-bundle rebalance pass (\u00b15% per-link clipping) using weights w = (1 \u2212 conf) * rate. This preserves router conservation, aligns parallel links, and reduces residual asymmetry, matching the top-tier router projection pattern.\n\n2. Enforce dominance-aware targeted scaling with Huber-like weight caps\n   - While distributing delta via w = (1 \u2212 conf) * max(rate, ZERO_THRESH), track each interface\u2019s total applied change across tiers and cap any single interface\u2019s share to \u226450% of the router\u2019s total correction, redistributing the excess to the remaining eligible links. Additionally, clip individual weights to w_i \u2264 0.5 * sum_j w_j and optionally use rate^0.95 to soften dominance. This retains the proven w-based allocation but prevents over-reliance on one skewed interface, improving counter repair without harming calibration.\n\n3. Escalate large-mismatch fusion and add an early soft-zero pre-pass\n   - In fuse_direction, make the snap-to-peer bias adaptive: beta = clamp(0.7 + 0.2 * clip01((mismatch \u2212 0.10)/0.20) + 0.1*[local_down or local<ZERO and peer\u2265ZERO] \u2212 0.1*[peer_down], 0.7, 0.9), then fused = (1 \u2212 beta)*local + beta*peer. Before router projection, add a near-zero pre-snap: if all four link directions < 1.5*ZERO_THRESH and both adjacent routers\u2019 imbalance \u2264 TAU_ROUTER, snap all four to 0 with high confidence. This tightens per-link symmetry earlier and reduces projection workload, consistent with Gen 42\u2019s zero-aware fast path.\n\n4. Refine router-side selection and add a micro high-confidence finishing tier\n   - Replace the side choice \u201clower aggregate confidence\u201d with an expected-penalty lookahead: estimate penalty_tx = \u03a3_i\u2208TX elig \u03c1(|\u0394_i|) and penalty_rx similarly (\u03c1 proportional to anticipated confidence loss from scaling), then adjust the side with the lower penalty; keep the same delta distribution formula. If residual remains > 0.6*TAU_ROUTER after the moderate tier, run a third micro-pass on high-confidence links (conf \u2265 0.85) with tiny clip 1.03 and damping 0.25 to close stubborn gaps without oscillation.\n\n5. Tighten confidence calibration with peer smoothing and strong-scale guards\n   - After the existing blend and 70/30 residual touch-up, smooth each direction\u2019s confidence with its peer-opposite by 10% when both ends are up: conf_dir = 0.90*conf_dir + 0.10*conf_peer_opposite. Apply an explicit strong-scale penalty: if strong_scaled_dir is set (|scale \u2212 1| > 0.08 in any stage), multiply confidence by 0.97; if a direction remained within 1% across all stages and final residual < TAU_H, boost by +0.02 up to 0.98. This aligns confidence more tightly to actual adjustment magnitude and final invariants, reinforcing the calibration gains seen in Gen 31/34/42.",
    "1. Add a conservation-preserving bundle finishing pass after Stage 2.5\n   - For parallel-link bundles (same local_router, remote_router), run a zero-sum residual alignment: compute e_i = tx_i \u2212 peer_rx_i per link, subtract the bundle median e_med, and apply a small correction \u0394_i = \u2212\u03b3\u00b7(e_i \u2212 e_med) with per-link clip \u00b13% and weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7rate_i. Apply \u0394 on tx_i and the opposite \u0394 on the peer\u2019s rx to keep both routers\u2019 totals unchanged; set \u03b3 = min(0.25, 0.5\u00b7TAU_H/rel_diff(tx_i, peer_rx_i)) and skip links hitting ZERO_THRESH. This tightens intra-bundle symmetry without disturbing router conservation, extending the proven gentle re-sync pattern.\n\n2. Switch router-side selection to an expected-penalty lookahead with dominance awareness\n   - For each router mismatch, estimate per-side penalty = \u03a3_i(|scale_i \u2212 1|) + 0.5\u00b7\u03a3_i(1 \u2212 conf_i), where scale_i derives from distributing delta using current weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7rate_i; add a dominance term 0.05\u00b7HHI with HHI = \u03a3_i (w_i/\u03a3_j w_j)^2. Choose the side with the lower penalty; if penalties are within 5%, fall back to the current \u201clower aggregate confidence\u201d rule. This preserves the successful tiered scaling while avoiding side choices that over-concentrate correction on dominant links.\n\n3. Make the post-projection re-sync gain adaptive and saturating\n   - Replace the linear gap gain with f = 0.4\u00b7sigmoid(5\u00b7(gap_norm \u2212 0.5)), where gap_norm = clip01((diff \u2212 tau_h_dir)/max(tau_h_dir, 1e-9)), and keep the existing attenuation by (1 \u2212 router_imbalance) and \u201cstrong_scaled\u201d guards. When both directions on a pair are low-confidence (<0.70) and both routers are within tolerance, allow a tiny bilateral nudge (0.10 toward the mean on both sides, \u00b12% clip) to close stubborn residuals safely. This keeps the proven \u201cadjust lower-confidence only\u201d strategy but adds smoother, mismatch-proportional response and a safe fallback for low-confidence stalemates.\n\n4. Introduce dynamic near-zero thresholds and an early soft-zero pre-pass\n   - Compute a per-router near-zero threshold thr_r = max(ZERO_THRESH, 0.002\u00b7(sum_tx_r + sum_rx_r)) and use max(thr_ra, thr_rb) in fusion and zero logic for links between routers ra/rb. Before router projection, if all four link directions < 1.5\u00b7max(thr_ra, thr_rb) and both routers\u2019 imbalances \u2264 TAU_ROUTER_LOCAL, snap all four to 0 with high confidence (\u22650.95). This generalizes the successful soft-zero handling and reduces projection workload on noise-level traffic.\n\n5. Enhance confidence calibration with improvement credit and router-aware smoothing\n   - Add an improvement term imp_dir = clamp01(pre_mismatch_dir \u2212 post_mismatch_dir) and blend it at weight 0.08 into the existing mix, rewarding actual redundancy gains. Apply router-aware smoothing for stable directions: if |scaled_factor \u2212 1| < 0.05, set conf_dir = 0.85\u00b7conf_dir + 0.15\u00b7mean_conf(router, dir); keep the final 70/30 symmetry touch-up. Add explicit strong-scale guards: if strong_scaled_dir or |scale \u2212 1| > 0.08, multiply confidence by",
    "1. Add expected-penalty router-side selection with dominance awareness\n   - Before deciding which side (tx vs rx) to adjust for a router mismatch, simulate the two-tier scaling using current weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7rate_i and k = delta/(0.6\u00b7\u03a3(rate_i\u00b7w_i)), then estimate per-side penalty = \u03a3_i|clip(1 + 0.6\u00b7k\u00b7w_i, [0.90, clip_hi(conf_i)]) \u2212 1| + 0.5\u00b7\u03a3_i(1 \u2212 conf_i) + 0.05\u00b7HHI, where HHI = \u03a3_i (w_i/\u03a3_j w_j)^2 and clip_hi(conf) = 1.12 for conf < 0.70 else 1.10. Choose the side with lower penalty; if penalties are within 5%, fall back to \u201clower aggregate confidence.\u201d This preserves the current tiered scaling but avoids picking the side that would concentrate changes on a dominant link set.\n\n2. Make the re-sync gain saturating and mismatch-proportional, with a guarded bilateral fallback\n   - Replace the linear re-sync gain with f = 0.4\u00b7sigmoid(5\u00b7(gap_norm \u2212 0.5)), where gap_norm = clip01((diff \u2212 tau_h_dir)/max(tau_h_dir, 1e\u22129)), and keep attenuation by (1 \u2212 router_imbalance). Cap each re-sync move by \u00b12% of max(tx, rx) per direction and retain the strong_scaled guards. When both directions on a pair are low-confidence (<0.70) and both routers are within tolerance, allow a bilateral micro-step f_bi = min(0.10, 0.5\u00b7gap_norm) toward the mean on both sides, clipped at \u00b12%, to close stubborn residuals safely.\n\n3. Use dominance-aware adaptive tier clips and introduce a tiny third tier for very low confidence\n   - In Stage 2, adapt clip ceilings per interface: for the low-confidence tier, set clip_hi_i = 1 + min(0.15, 0.10 + 0.05\u00b7(0.70 \u2212 conf_i)+); for the moderate tier, keep 1.10 but reduce for dominant links by clip_hi_i \u2190 1 + (clip_hi_i \u2212 1)\u00b7(1 \u2212 sqrt(HHI)). Tighten the dominance cap to cap_abs = (0.5 \u2212 0.2\u00b7sqrt(HHI))\u00b7|delta| and add a third micro-tier for conf < 0.50 with clip_hi = 1.15 but cap per-interface absolute change to \u2264 0.35\u00b7|delta|. Also shield near-zero traffic by excluding interfaces with rate < max(ZERO_THRESH, thr_router) from the final uniform alpha step to avoid reintroducing low-rate jitter.\n\n4. Refine bundle finishing with dispersion-aware gamma and per-router zero-sum enforcement\n   - Compute residuals e_i and use a robust center (median or 20% trimmed mean for bundles \u22643 links), then scale corrections by Huber weights using k = 1.5\u00b7MAD(e). Set per-link gamma_i = min(0.30, 0.5\u00b7TAU_H/max(rel_diff(tx, rx), 1e\u22129))\u00b7w_huber_i and clip \u0394_i to \u00b1c_i\u00b7rate_i with c_i in [0.02, 0.04] growing with bundle size/dispersion. After computing \u0394_i for a direction, remove per-router means from \u0394 to make the adjustment strictly zero-sum within each router and still apply equal/opposite on the peer direction; this tightens bundle symmetry without nudging router totals.\n\n5. Enrich confidence calibration with stability, bundle-consistency, and router-aware smoothing\n   - Add a stability term stab_i = clamp01(1 \u2212 0.5\u00b7share_i) where share_i = rate_i/\u03a3_router_dir rate to downweight interfaces whose values strongly influence router balance, and a bundle-consistency term bcons_i = clamp01(1 \u2212 |e_i \u2212 median(e)|/(|median(e)| + max(rate_i, 1))). Blend these at small weights (e.g., +0.05\u00b7stab_i + 0.06\u00b7bcons_i) into the current mix, and apply router-aware smoothing when |scale \u2212 1| < 0.05: conf = 0.85\u00b7conf + 0.15\u00b7mean_conf(router, dir). Keep existing penalties for strong scaling and clip hits, but add a small extra penalty (\u00d70.97) when an interface both hit a clip and increased the router\u2019s imbalance pre-to-post, reinforcing alignment between action and reliability.",
    "1. Split-burden dual-side router projection on near-ties\n   - When expected-penalty(side) is within 8\u201310% between tx and rx, split the correction: apply 70% of delta to the lower-penalty side using the current tiered scaling, recompute the residual, then apply the remaining 30% to the other side with its own tiers/caps. Keep all existing dominance caps, per-interface clips, and near-zero shielding. This reduces concentration on dominant link sets and consistently lowers clip hits.\n\n2. Dominance- and share-aware bounds plus weighted final uniform step\n   - Replace the fixed 0.90 lower clip bound with an adaptive floor per interface: lb_i = 0.90 + 0.05\u00b7sqrt(HHI) + 0.05\u00b7share_i, clipped to \u22640.97, and use it across all tiered clamps (micro/low/moderate) to avoid over-downscaling dominant/high-share links. In the final damped \u201cuniform\u201d step, distribute alpha_eff with weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7(1 \u2212 share_i) over eligible interfaces, applying alpha_i = 1 + 0.4\u00b7(alpha \u2212 1)\u00b7w_i/\u03a3w and capping each alpha_i to [0.97, 1.03]. This extends the current dominance-aware scaling and should improve counter accuracy by protecting heavy hitters while letting slack capacity carry corrections.\n\n3. Router-conservation\u2013biased fusion for large per-link mismatches\n   - In fuse_direction\u2019s \u201clarge mismatch\u201d regime, bias the fused value toward the side that reduces router imbalance: fused = avg + \u03b2\u00b7(target_side \u2212 avg), where avg = 0.5\u00b7(v_local + v_peer), \u03b2 \u2208 [0.2, 0.4] grows with router gap: \u03b2 = min(0.4, 0.5\u00b7((imb_a + imb_b)/tau_avg \u2212 1)+), with imb_r = rel_diff(\u03a3tx_r, \u03a3rx_r) and tau_avg the mean tau_router. Add status/near-zero shielding and keep current snap-to-peer rules when one end is near-zero or down. This nudges links toward conservation earlier, reducing the load on Stage 2 while preserving asymmetries where routers are already balanced.\n\n4. Two-pass, saturating re-sync for stubborn residuals\n   - After the current re-sync pass, identify link-directions still outside tolerance by >1.5\u00d7 tau_h_dir and with both routers within tolerance; run a second micro-pass with halved gain and tighter cap: f2 = 0.5\u00b7f_gain\u00b7min(0.20, gap_norm), per-move cap \u00b11% of local reference. Keep \u201conly adjust lower-confidence side\u201d and bilateral micro-step rules, and continue to skip any interface flagged strong_scaled or clip-hit in Stage 2. This safely closes persistent residuals without compromising conservation.\n\n5. Confidence- and share-aware bundle finishing with exact per-router zero-sum\n   - In the bundle finishing pass, modulate gamma per member by confidence and share: gamma_i \u2190 gamma_i\u00b7(1 \u2212 c_mean_i) and set per-link caps cap_frac_i in [0.02, 0.04]\u00b7(1 \u2212 0.5\u00b7share_dir_i), making dominant members slightly stiffer. After computing deltas, enforce exact zero-sum per router by subtracting each router\u2019s total \u0394 (not just the mean) proportionally across its eligible members; then apply equal/opposite to peers. This preserves router totals precisely while reducing intra-bundle dispersion more effectively on low-confidence links.",
    "1. Replace side selection with expected-penalty scoring and add a 70/30 split on near ties\n   - For each router, compute S_tx = \u03a3_i (1 \u2212 conf_tx[i])\u00b7tx[i] and S_rx = \u03a3_i (1 \u2212 conf_rx[i])\u00b7rx[i]; pick the side with the larger S_side to adjust. If |S_tx \u2212 S_rx|/max(S_tx, S_rx) \u2264 0.10, apply 70% of the residual on the lower-penalty side, recompute, then apply the remaining 30% on the other side, keeping existing dominance caps, tier clips (1.12/1.10), and near-zero shielding. This preserves the current dominance-aware pattern but reduces concentration and clip hits in borderline cases.\n\n2. Make bounds share- and dominance-aware and distribute the final uniform step by slack\n   - Replace the fixed 0.90 floor with lb_i = min(0.97, 0.90 + 0.05\u00b7sqrt(HHI_router) + 0.05\u00b7share_i), and use lb_i across both tiers and the uniform step; keep clip highs at 1.12 (low-conf) and 1.10 (mid-conf). In the final damped pass, distribute alpha via weights w_i = (1 \u2212 conf_i)\u00b7(1 \u2212 share_i), applying alpha_i = 1 + 0.4\u00b7(alpha \u2212 1)\u00b7w_i/\u03a3w and capping per-interface alpha_i to [0.97, 1.03]. This protects dominant links while letting slack, low-confidence members absorb more correction, improving counter accuracy without overshoot.\n\n3. Bias Stage 1 fusion toward router conservation in large mismatches\n   - In fuse_direction\u2019s large-mismatch branch, nudge toward the side that reduces router residuals: fused = avg + \u03b2\u00b7(target_side \u2212 avg), avg = 0.5\u00b7(v_local + v_peer), with \u03b2 = min(0.4, 0.5\u00b7(((imb_a + imb_b)/tau_avg) \u2212 1)+), where imb_r is rel_diff(\u03a3tx_r, \u03a3rx_r) and tau_avg is the mean tau_router of the two routers. Retain the current status/near-zero shields and snap-to-peer rules when one end is near-zero or down. This moves conservation earlier, easing Stage 2 while keeping link asymmetries where routers are already balanced.\n\n4. Add a second, saturating re-sync micro-pass gated by tolerance and router balance\n   - After the existing re-sync, identify link-directions with residual > 1.5\u00d7 tau_h_dir and with both adjacent routers within their tau_router; run a second pass with halved gain and tight caps: f2 = 0.5\u00b7f_gain\u00b7min(0.20, gap"
