# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Adaptive per-link, direction-wise fusion with status/zero-aware regimes and decisive snap-to-peer
  - Current best: Hybrid Hodor Link-Router Telemetry Repair with Adaptive Fusion (Gen 42) achieved 0.94 combined (0.936 counter, 0.931 confidence) using three regimes (keep within tight tau, average for moderate mismatches, 30/70 peer-biased snap for large mismatches) with a near-zero fast path and TX↔peer-RX symmetry mapping. Similar hybrids at 0.93 combined include Gen 30, 31, 34, and 35 (counter 0.928–0.931; confidence 0.930–0.934).
- Conservative, confidence-weighted router projection with adaptive tolerances and tiered, clipped scaling
  - Gen 42 and Gen 37 (also 0.94 combined; 0.936 counter, 0.931 confidence) select the lower-confidence side and distribute deltas by w=(1−conf)*rate with damping. Tiered bands target low-confidence links first (wider clips up to 1.12), then moderate-confidence (clip 1.10), finishing with a uniform, small damped scaling. This closes router gaps without oscillation and outperforms bundle-aware and WLS variants on counter accuracy.
- Post-projection, confidence-gap re-sync of only the lower-confidence direction with guards
  - Gen 42, 31, and 35 nudge toward the mean by up to 0.4 based on the confidence gap, attenuated by router imbalance and guarded by “strong-scale” flags. This consistently tightens residual asymmetries and sustains top-tier calibration (≥0.930).
- Multi-factor confidence calibration aligned to final invariants
  - Blending base confidence, pre/post symmetry, change magnitude, router imbalance after projection, and explicit scale penalties, plus a final 70/30 symmetry-residual touch-up when both ends are up, yields high calibration: Gen 42 at 0.931; top 0.93 cluster reaches 0.932–0.934 (e.g., Gen 31 at 0.932; Gen 33 and 34 at 0.934).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Pure consensus/alternating projection solvers weakened calibration despite perfect status
  - Weighted Consensus Telemetry Repair (Gen 38) scored 0.65 combined (counter 0.656, confidence 0.561); Alternating L2 Network Telemetry Equalizer (Gen 41) reached 0.81 combined (counter 0.811, confidence 0.756). Feedback points to residual-to-confidence mapping and weighting issues that trail counter/status performance.
- Exact WLS router projections with tight per-variable clipping under-corrected large or asymmetric flows
  - WLS Link Hardening with Router Projection (Gen 32) dropped to 0.90 combined (counter 0.897, confidence 0.902) with feedback citing “residual mismatches on high-rate/asymmetric links.” Other WLS variants (Gen 36, 40, 43) clustered at 0.92 combined; feedback notes stability from clipping/dominance caps but lower counter repair.
- Overly conservative caps/damping and dominance caps slowed convergence and left residual imbalances
  - Bundle-aware Router Sync with Confidence Calibration (Gen 33) at 0.93 combined notes conservative 10% clip/damping leaving small residual asymmetries; Bundle-Aware Telemetry Repair (Gen 39; 0.92 combined) and Bundle-aware Consensus Telemetry Repair (Gen 44; 0.93 combined) similarly cite dominance caps and clipping as limiting corrections under skewed telemetry.
- Confidence schemes dominated by heavy penalties or misaligned residual mappings depressed calibration
  - Prior evidence: heavy residual-based penalties (e.g., Gen 16 at 0.605 confidence; Gen 19 at 0.688). In this batch, Gen 38’s feedback explicitly calls out confidence weighting/mapping as a weakness.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective (Gen 42; 0.94 combined)
  - Router scaling math matches strong prior patterns: distribute delta by w=(1−conf)*rate with damping; tiered adjustments with per-interface clips (low-conf clip 1.12; moderate 1.10) and a final uniform alpha clipped

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add bundle-aware router scaling with intra-bundle smoothing
   - Detect parallel-link bundles by grouping interfaces with the same (local_router, remote_router). When a bundle contributes ≥60% of the adjusted side’s traffic on a router, apply a shared alpha_eff = 1 + 0.6*(clip[0.85, 1.15](target/current) − 1) to the whole bundle, then run a small intra-bundle rebalance pass (±5% per-link clipping) using weights w = (1 − conf) * rate. This preserves router conservation, aligns parallel links, and reduces residual asymmetry, matching the top-tier router projection pattern.

2. Enforce dominance-aware targeted scaling with Huber-like weight caps
   - While distributing delta via w = (1 − conf) * max(rate, ZERO_THRESH), track each interface’s total applied change across tiers and cap any single interface’s share to ≤50% of the router’s total correction, redistributing the excess to the remaining eligible links. Additionally, clip individual weights to w_i ≤ 0.5 * sum_j w_j and optionally use rate^0.95 to soften dominance. This retains the proven w-based allocation but prevents over-reliance on one skewed interface, improving counter repair without harming calibration.

3. Escalate large-mismatch fusion and add an early soft-zero pre-pass
   - In fuse_direction, make the snap-to-peer bias adaptive: beta = clamp(0.7 + 0.2 * clip01((mismatch − 0.10)/0.20) + 0.1*[local_down or local<ZERO and peer≥ZERO] − 0.1*[peer_down], 0.7, 0.9), then fused = (1 − beta)*local + beta*peer. Before router projection, add a near-zero pre-snap: if all four link directions < 1.5*ZERO_THRESH and both adjacent routers’ imbalance ≤ TAU_ROUTER, snap all four to 0 with high confidence. This tightens per-link symmetry earlier and reduces projection workload, consistent with Gen 42’s zero-aware fast path.

4. Refine router-side selection and add a micro high-confidence finishing tier
   - Replace the side choice “lower aggregate confidence” with an expected-penalty lookahead: estimate penalty_tx = Σ_i∈TX elig ρ(|Δ_i|) and penalty_rx similarly (ρ proportional to anticipated confidence loss from scaling), then adjust the side with the lower penalty; keep the same delta distribution formula. If residual remains > 0.6*TAU_ROUTER after the moderate tier, run a third micro-pass on high-confidence links (conf ≥ 0.85) with tiny clip 1.03 and damping 0.25 to close stubborn gaps without oscillation.

5. Tighten confidence calibration with peer smoothing and strong-scale guards
   - After the existing blend and 70/30 residual touch-up, smooth each direction’s confidence with its peer-opposite by 10% when both ends are up: conf_dir = 0.90*conf_dir + 0.10*conf_peer_opposite. Apply an explicit strong-scale penalty: if strong_scaled_dir is set (|scale − 1| > 0.08 in any stage), multiply confidence by 0.97; if a direction remained within 1% across all stages and final residual < TAU_H, boost by +0.02 up to 0.98. This aligns confidence more tightly to actual adjustment magnitude and final invariants, reinforcing the calibration gains seen in Gen 31/34/42.
