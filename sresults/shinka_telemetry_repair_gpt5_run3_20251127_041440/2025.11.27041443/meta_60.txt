# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Current best: Hybrid Hodor repair (Combined 0.94; counter 0.936; status 1.000; confidence 0.931) confirms the top-performing pattern from prior best (Gen 42 at 0.94): adaptive per-link, direction-wise fusion with three regimes (keep within adaptive tau, average for moderate mismatches, status/zero-aware snap for large), followed by a conservative, confidence-weighted router projection that selects the lower-confidence side, applies tiered, clipped scaling (low-conf clip to 1.12; moderate clip to 1.10) and a small, uniform damped scaling.
- Post-projection confidence-gap re-sync that nudges only the lower-confidence direction with guards (attenuated by router imbalance and protected by “strong-scale” flags) consistently tightened symmetry without double-adjustment, sustaining high calibration in the current best and the 0.93 cluster (e.g., Hybrid Link with Router Projection, Gen 51: 0.93 combined; 0.925 counter; 0.933 confidence).
- Multi-factor confidence calibration aligned to final invariants—blending base confidence, redundancy (pre/post symmetry), change magnitude, router balance, explicit scaling penalties, and a final peer symmetry touch-up—delivered top-tier calibration in the current best (0.931) and peers (Gen 48/51/59 at 0.926–0.933 confidence).
- Soft-zero and traffic-aware status logic produced near-universal perfect status accuracy; every top method reported 1.000 status, including the current best, Hybrids (Gen 48/51/52/53/59), bundle-aware pipelines (Gen 45/46/50), WLS variants (Gen 57/58), and consensus solvers (Gen 54/55).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Consensus/alternating projections (ADMM/POCS Telemetry Consensus Repair, Gen 54: combined 0.76; counter 0.759; confidence 0.727; Global Consensus Projections, Gen 55: combined 0.64; counter 0.629; confidence 0.608) weakened both counter accuracy and calibration. Feedback points to confidence mapping/weighting issues that trail otherwise-stable status handling.
- Exact WLS router projections with tight per-variable clips under-corrected large or asymmetric flows (WLS Link Reconciliation with Re-sync, Gen 57: combined 0.92; counter 0.916; confidence 0.917; WLS Link Hardening with Router Re-sync, Gen 58: combined 0.83; counter 0.819; confidence 0.820). Feedback cites residual imbalances and under-correction due to clipping/damping and dominance caps.
- Overly conservative caps/damping and dominance caps in bundle-aware scaling limited correction magnitude, leaving residual imbalances and constraining scores to ~0.92–0.93 (Bundle-aware consensus telemetry repair, Gen 45: combined 0.93; counter 0.925; confidence 0.919; Gen 46: combined 0.92; counter 0.913; confidence 0.911; Gen 50: combined 0.92; counter 0.917; confidence 0.916). Feedback repeatedly attributes headroom loss to clipping penalties and conservative scaling guards.
- Complex bundle/Huber pipelines did not surpass hybrid projections; Bundle-Huber Flow Sync (Gen 47) reached 0.83 combined (counter 0.827; confidence 0.807). The extreme outlier (hodor_bundle_penalty_pipeline, Gen 49) scored 0.06 combined despite passing validation, indicating sensitivity to threshold/weight configuration.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective:
  - Per-link fusion uses an adaptive tolerance tau_h_dir (1.5–3%) and three regimes with status/zero bias and 0.3/0.7 snap to peer for large mismatches, producing symmetric hardened counters and strong pre/post symmetry alignment (driving 0.936 counter accuracy).
  - Router projection selects the side with lower aggregate link confidence and distributes deltas by weights proportional to (1−confidence)*rate, in two targeted tiers (conf <0.70 up to 1.12 clip; 0.70–0.85 up to 1.10) plus a small uniform damped scaling (alpha_eff = 1 + 0.4*(alpha−1), clipped 0.95–1.05). Per-interface min clip at 0.90 and an absolute per-interface change cap (0.5*|delta|) prevent overcorrection; “strong_scaled” flags guard against subsequent re-sync adjustments.
  - Post-projection re-sync adjusts only the lower-confidence direction using a factor up to 0.4 of the confidence gap, attenuated by (1 − router imbalance). This reduces final asymmetries while preserving router-level balance, a pattern mirrored in high performers (Gen 52/53/59 at 0.93 combined).
  - Confidence calibration blends: base conf (0.23), redundancy (pre 0.20; post 0.27), change magnitude (0.10), router balance after projection (0.10), and scale penalty (0.10), with clip-hit penalty and untouched boost, then a final 70/30 symmetry residual touch-up. This mirrors the “multi-factor aligned to final invariants” pattern seen in Gen 51 (confidence 0.933) and Gen 48/59 (0.926).
- Hybrid variants that add micro finishing and explicit scaling penalties in confidence (Gen 48/51/52/59; 0.93 combined) corroborate that conservative, tiered scaling plus guarded re-sync and invariant-aligned calibration is robust across scenarios.
- Bundle-aware and WLS implementations consistently incorporate clipping, dominance caps, and damping; however, their tighter caps or solver rigidity leave residual imbalances on high-rate/asymmetric links, aligning with their lower counter scores (0.916–0.917 for WLS Gen 57; ~0.913–0.917 for bundle-aware Gen 45/46/50).

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add a conservation-preserving bundle finishing pass after Stage 2.5
   - For parallel-link bundles (same local_router, remote_router), run a zero-sum residual alignment: compute e_i = tx_i − peer_rx_i per link, subtract the bundle median e_med, and apply a small correction Δ_i = −γ·(e_i − e_med) with per-link clip ±3% and weights w_i = (1 − conf_i)·rate_i. Apply Δ on tx_i and the opposite Δ on the peer’s rx to keep both routers’ totals unchanged; set γ = min(0.25, 0.5·TAU_H/rel_diff(tx_i, peer_rx_i)) and skip links hitting ZERO_THRESH. This tightens intra-bundle symmetry without disturbing router conservation, extending the proven gentle re-sync pattern.

2. Switch router-side selection to an expected-penalty lookahead with dominance awareness
   - For each router mismatch, estimate per-side penalty = Σ_i(|scale_i − 1|) + 0.5·Σ_i(1 − conf_i), where scale_i derives from distributing delta using current weights w_i = (1 − conf_i)·rate_i; add a dominance term 0.05·HHI with HHI = Σ_i (w_i/Σ_j w_j)^2. Choose the side with the lower penalty; if penalties are within 5%, fall back to the current “lower aggregate confidence” rule. This preserves the successful tiered scaling while avoiding side choices that over-concentrate correction on dominant links.

3. Make the post-projection re-sync gain adaptive and saturating
   - Replace the linear gap gain with f = 0.4·sigmoid(5·(gap_norm − 0.5)), where gap_norm = clip01((diff − tau_h_dir)/max(tau_h_dir, 1e-9)), and keep the existing attenuation by (1 − router_imbalance) and “strong_scaled” guards. When both directions on a pair are low-confidence (<0.70) and both routers are within tolerance, allow a tiny bilateral nudge (0.10 toward the mean on both sides, ±2% clip) to close stubborn residuals safely. This keeps the proven “adjust lower-confidence only” strategy but adds smoother, mismatch-proportional response and a safe fallback for low-confidence stalemates.

4. Introduce dynamic near-zero thresholds and an early soft-zero pre-pass
   - Compute a per-router near-zero threshold thr_r = max(ZERO_THRESH, 0.002·(sum_tx_r + sum_rx_r)) and use max(thr_ra, thr_rb) in fusion and zero logic for links between routers ra/rb. Before router projection, if all four link directions < 1.5·max(thr_ra, thr_rb) and both routers’ imbalances ≤ TAU_ROUTER_LOCAL, snap all four to 0 with high confidence (≥0.95). This generalizes the successful soft-zero handling and reduces projection workload on noise-level traffic.

5. Enhance confidence calibration with improvement credit and router-aware smoothing
   - Add an improvement term imp_dir = clamp01(pre_mismatch_dir − post_mismatch_dir) and blend it at weight 0.08 into the existing mix, rewarding actual redundancy gains. Apply router-aware smoothing for stable directions: if |scaled_factor − 1| < 0.05, set conf_dir = 0.85·conf_dir + 0.15·mean_conf(router, dir); keep the final 70/30 symmetry touch-up. Add explicit strong-scale guards: if strong_scaled_dir or |scale − 1| > 0.08, multiply confidence by
