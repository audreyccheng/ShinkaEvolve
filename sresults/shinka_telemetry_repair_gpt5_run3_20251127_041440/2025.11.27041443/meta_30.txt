# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Link-Symmetry Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Two-pass repair leverages connected-to pairs for link symmetry and status consistency with a 2% tolerance; repairs use peer counters and set confidence as 1 minus normalized violation magnitude. Flow conservation is documented but not implemented, and the topology argument is not used beyond metadata.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.83 with counter_repair_accuracy 0.826, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, and confidence_calibration 0.822.
- **Feedback**: Perfect status repair indicates robust handling of status mismatches, and confidence is well-calibrated due to violation-scaled scoring. Counter repair may benefit from actually using the topology and implementing router-level flow conservation to address cases without clean symmetric signals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hodor Link Hardening with Router Projection**
- **Implementation**: Three-step pipeline: bidirectional link fusion (my_tx vs peer_rx, my_rx vs peer_tx) using near-zero and status-aware weights; router-level projection enforces flow conservation by scaling the lower-confidence side and penalizing large adjustments. Final confidences blend link symmetry, redundancy, change magnitude, and router imbalance; status is repaired peerwise with traffic-aware overrides.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.82 (counter_repair_accuracy 0.811, status_repair_accuracy 1.000, confidence_calibration 0.809).
- **Feedback**: Link fusion plus router projection yielded strong counter repair and perfect status repair; confidence calibration is good but not maximal. Tuning mismatch thresholds or scaling penalties may further tighten calibration without sacrificing accuracy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name robust_link_router_projection - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Symmetry- and Conservation-Based Telemetry Repair**
- **Implementation**: Uses bilateral link symmetry with a 2% tolerance to harden counters by averaging local and peer measurements, then applies router-level flow conservation that adjusts the lower-confidence side with weighted distribution by magnitude and confidence.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Hybrid per-link fusion with tight symmetry tolerance and ZERO/status-aware regimes
  - The current best program (Hybrid Hodor repair; 0.93 combined, 0.930 counter, 0.935 confidence) uses TAU_H=2%, ZERO_THRESH≈0.1, and three mismatch regimes (keep/average/snap with 30/70 bias), producing both high counter accuracy and top-tier calibration. Hybrid Link-Flow Telemetry Repair (Gen 24; 0.930 counter, 0.935 confidence) mirrors this design with equally strong results.
- Conservative, confidence-weighted router projection with damping and clipping
  - Adjust the aggregate lower-confidence side using per-interface weights w=(1−conf)*rate, damped scaling (60%) and clipped factors (per-interface 0.90–1.10; uniform fallback 0.85–1.15). This pattern, present in the current best, Gen 15, and Gen 29 (0.925 counter, 0.919 confidence), consistently lifts counters without destabilizing calibration.
- Post-projection, confidence-gap–guided link re-sync on the lower-confidence side
  - Gently nudge only the lower-confidence direction toward the mean (fraction up to 0.4 based on confidence gap), with a cautious symmetric nudge when both confidences are low. This appears in the current best, Gen 21 (0.914 confidence), and Gen 22 (0.935 confidence), and correlates with the strongest calibration (≥0.919) while preserving counter gains.
- Multi-factor confidence calibration with residual-aware touch-up
  - Blend base link confidence (including scale penalties), pre/post symmetry agreement, change magnitude, and router imbalance after projection; then apply a final 70/30 symmetry-residual touch-up only when both ends are up. The current best and Gen 24 reach 0.935 confidence; Gen 22 achieves 0.935 confidence with slightly lower counter accuracy (0.920), reinforcing the efficacy of this blend.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Overly conservative per-interface caps/damping and strict nudge gating limited counter correction
  - Topology-aware telemetry repair with symmetry and conservation (Gen 20; 0.83 combined; 0.812 counter, 0.831 confidence) and Symmetry and Flow-Conserving Telemetry Repair (Gen 23; 0.83 combined; 0.812 counter, 0.832 confidence) used ±10% caps with 0.6 damping and strict symmetry/nudge gating. Feedback attributes remaining counter gaps to caps and strict tolerances limiting correction magnitude.
- Heavy residual-based caps and scale penalties depressed confidence calibration
  - Bundle-aware telemetry repair with adaptive re-sync (Gen 19; 0.80 combined; 0.688 confidence) suffered from “residual-based caps and scale penalties likely depress confidence calibration.” Similarly, r1r3_confidence_hardened (Gen 16; 0.78 combined; 0.605 confidence) cites a conservative 10% scaling cap and post-calibration clamping as likely causes for weak calibration despite perfect status.
- Prior global evidence: omitting router projection or weak router context hurt counters
  - Earlier generations without robust router projection (e.g., Gen 2; 0.80 combined; 0.773 counter) underperformed, reinforcing that R1-style router balancing is necessary to resolve asymmetric/sparse signals.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective
  - Link fusion: Direction-wise, regime-based fusion with near-zero fast-path to zero (confidence ~0.95), keep within 2%, average within 10%, and status/zero-aware snap with 30/70 bias for large mismatches. This stabilizes symmetry before router-level corrections, enabling high counter accuracy.
  - Router projection: Select the side with lower aggregate link confidence (sum of per-direction confidences) and distribute adjustments by w=(1−conf)*rate, ensuring large, low-confidence flows absorb more change. Apply damping (0.6) and clips (per-interface 0.90–1.10; fallback 0.85–1.15). Record scale factors and penalize confidence proportionally to |scale−1| (e.g., conf *= 1−0.4*penalty) to align confidence with adjustment magnitude.
  - Confidence-aware re-sync: After projection, reconcile residual asymmetry by nudging only the lower-confidence side toward the mean using a fraction tied to confidence gap (capped at 0.4), with a small symmetric nudge when both sides are low-confidence. This reduces post-mismatch without double-adjusting high-confidence sides.
  - Confidence composition and safe touch-up: Blend base confidence, pre/post redundancy, change magnitude, router imbalance after projection, and scale penalties, then apply a 70/30 final symmetry-residual touch-up only when both ends are up. This avoids inflating downed links and improves calibration (0.935).
- Concrete coding patterns linked to impact
  - Scaling math: k = (target − current) / Σ(v*w); per-interface scale_i = clip(1 + 0.6*k*w, 0.90–1.10). Fallback uniform alpha uses clip to 0.85–1.15 with the same damping. These guardrails prevent over-correction while closing router imbalances.
  - Robust topology handling: Build router_ifaces from topology with local_router fallbacks, ignore trivial routers, and preserve interface status semantics with down=>zero enforcement. This contributes to status_repair_accuracy = 1.000 across all evaluated programs.

## Performance Analysis
- Top-tier cluster (combined 0.93) shares the same core design, with slight trade-offs
  - Current best and Gen 24 both attain 0.930 counter and 0.935 confidence. Gen 22 reaches 0.935 confidence via similar calibration and re-sync but with a slightly lower counter (0.920), suggesting minor clamp/tolerance choices trade counter convergence for calibration.
- Bundle-aware variants are competitive but slightly conservative
  - Gen 25, 27, 28, 29 (combined 0.92–0.93; counter 0.919–0.925; confidence 0.918–0.919) apply bundle-aware scaling with ±15% group scaling and ±10% per-interface clipping plus damping. Feedback repeatedly notes “minor under-corrections” and residual counter gaps likely from conservative clipping/damping, despite strong calibration.
- Conservatism without targeted re-sync leads to solid calibration but lower counter repair
  - Gen 20 and 23 (0.83 combined; 0.812 counter; ~0.831 confidence) show that guarded scaling with strict caps and minimal or gated symmetry nudges preserves calibration but fails to fully correct counters.
- Confidence calibration tracks inclusion of residual-aware blending and post-symmetry touch-up
  - Programs incorporating both post-projection re-sync and final residual-based confidence touch-up achieve ≥0.919 calibration (e.g., current best 0.935; Gen 24 0.935; Gen 22 0.935), whereas those with heavy clamping or misaligned penalties underperform (Gen 16 at 0.605; Gen 19 at 0.688). Status repair is saturated at 1.000 across the board, so differentiation hinges on counter accuracy and confidence calibration.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Two-tier, targeted router scaling with dominance cap
   - When a router is imbalanced, first allocate correction only to low-confidence, active interfaces (conf < 0.70) using weights w_i = (1 − conf_i) * max(rate_i, ZERO_THRESH), with per-interface scale_i = clip(1 + 0.6 * k * w_i, 0.90–1.12). If residual imbalance remains > 0.5*TAU_ROUTER, spill over to a second tier (0.70 ≤ conf < 0.85) using the same formula but clipped to 0.90–1.10. Cap any single interface’s share of the total correction to ≤50% and redistribute the remainder to prevent over-reliance on one link, preserving calibration while closing counter gaps.

2. Bundle-aware group scaling with intra-bundle smoothing
   - Detect parallel-link bundles by grouping interfaces with the same (local_router, remote_router). If a bundle contributes ≥60% of the adjusted side’s traffic on that router, compute a shared alpha_eff = 1 + 0.6*(clip(0.85–1.15, target/current) − 1) for the group, then apply a small intra-bundle rebalance pass using ±5% per-link clipping weighted by (1 − conf)*rate. This aligns with the proven router projection and reduces residual asymmetry across parallel links, easing the load on post-projection re-sync.

3. Confidence-gap re-sync with scaling guard and router-imbalance attenuation
   - Keep the one-sided nudge, but skip re-sync on a direction that just had strong scaling: if |scaled_{tx/rx}_factor − 1| > 0.08 on that side, do not nudge it in this cycle. Otherwise, use f = min(0.4, max(0, conf_high − conf_low)) and attenuate by local router imbalance: f *= clamp01(1 − router_imbalance(local_router)), then move only the lower-confidence side toward the mean by fraction f; when both sides have low confidence (<0.7), apply a cautious symmetric nudge f ≈ 0.10–0.15. This avoids double-adjusting recently scaled links and preserves router conservation while reducing post-mismatch.

4. Adaptive tolerances and soft-zero stabilization
   - Make TAU_H tiered: 0.015 when both sides > 100 Mbps and both confidences ≥ 0.8; 0.02 baseline; 0.03 when either side < 1 Mbps or confidence < 0.7 to suppress low-rate jitter. Set TAU_ROUTER adaptively based on active interfaces n_active: TAU_ROUTER = clip(0.03, 0.07, 0.05 * sqrt(2 / max(2, n_active))). Add a soft-zero rule: if both directions on a link are < 2*ZERO_THRESH and neither adjacent router shows imbalance > TAU_ROUTER, snap both to 0 with high confidence, reinforcing the current best’s near-zero handling.

5. Confidence calibration refinements: peer smoothing, clip-hit penalty, untouched boost
   - Keep the existing multi-factor blend and 70/30 residual touch-up, then add a 10% peer smoothing: conf_dir = 0.90*conf_dir + 0.10*conf_peer_opposite when both ends are up. Apply a mild clip-hit penalty: if a direction’s scaling was clipped (reached 0.90 or 1.10) or |scale_factor − 1| ≥ 0.10, multiply its confidence by 0.95; conversely, if a direction changed < 1% across all stages and final symmetry is good (residual < TAU_H), boost confidence by +0.02 up to 0.98. These tweaks align confidence more tightly with actual adjustment magnitude and final agreement, matching patterns seen in the top-tier programs.
