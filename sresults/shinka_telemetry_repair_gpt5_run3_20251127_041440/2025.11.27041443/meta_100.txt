# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Hybrid Hodor pattern (current best): adaptive per-link fusion + conservative, confidence-weighted router projection + gentle re-sync consistently yields top scores. The current best program “Hybrid Hodor repair: robust link hardening with adaptive fusion + conservative router projection” achieves Combined 0.94 (counter 0.936, status 1.000, confidence 0.942). It uses tau_h_dir 1.5–3%, tau_router(n)=0.05*sqrt(2/max(2,n)) clamped [0.03,0.07], two-tier scaling with 0.90 lower bound and clip highs 1.12/1.10, uniform damping 0.4, and re-sync of the lower-confidence side only. Peers with the same pattern (Gen 90/91/92/94/97/99) match Combined 0.94 with counter ≈0.935–0.937 and confidence ≈0.933–0.942.
- Dominance/expected-penalty side selection with caps prevents overshoot while closing router residuals. Current best and Gen 91/94/97 select the lower-confidence side, use weights proportional to (1-conf)*rate, and cap per-interface changes (dominance-aware), producing perfect status and high counter accuracy (0.936–0.937).
- Targeted post-projection re-sync improves link symmetry without breaking conservation. Current best and Gen 90/91/94 adjust only the lower-confidence direction, gate by router imbalance, and keep small factors; this tightens directional agreement and contributes to stable confidence (≥0.942).
- Confidence calibrated to actions and invariants is crucial. Current best blends pre/post mismatches, change magnitude, router imbalance, scale/clipping penalties, stability and bundle-consistency, plus peer smoothing, reaching 0.942. Gen 98 pushes calibration to 0.945 by adding router/peer smoothing and scaling guards while keeping counter 0.935.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Global/iterative POCS projections underperform on both counter and confidence. Gen 95 (“global_weighted_pocs”, Combined 0.83; counter 0.837; confidence 0.785) and Gen 96 (“global_pocs_projection”, Combined 0.66; counter 0.653; confidence 0.617) show that alternating projections with generic WLS, even with HHI-aware caps and non-negativity damping, leave residual imbalances and decouple confidence from actual invariant improvements.
- Overly conservative consensus/bundle caps cap performance. Gen 93 (“two_pass_micro_resync_and_router_residual_fix”, Combined 0.94; counter 0.931; confidence 0.934) uses guarded, bundle-aware scaling with adaptive clipping/guards; feedback flags hyperparameter sensitivity and residual imbalances—consistent with the broader observation that strict per-link/bundle caps plateau counter ≈0.925–0.931.
- Simpler or linear residual-only confidence mappings limit calibration. POCS variants relying on linear blends and modest smoothing settle at confidence 0.617–0.785, versus ≥0.936 when confidence is tied to post-projection invariants, scale magnitude, and clip-hit penalties (current best; Gen 91/92/94/98).

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective:
  - Adaptive tolerances at both link and router levels closely match prior winning settings: tau_h_dir returns 1.5–3% based on rate/confidence; tau_router(n) follows 0.05*sqrt(2/max(2,n)) within [0.03, 0.07]. This suppresses low-rate jitter yet doesn’t hide true imbalance (mirrors Gen 90/91/92/94).
  - Confidence-weighted, tiered scaling with strict bounds and dominance caps: two tiers (<0.70 to 1.12; 0.70–0.85 to 1.10) with a 0.90 floor, weights proportional to (1-conf)*rate, per-interface dominance cap (≤50% of remaining delta), followed by a uniformly damped step (alpha_eff with 0.4 damping). This exact structure also appears in Gen 91/94/97 and underpins counter 0.936–0.937 without overshoot.
  - Re-sync is surgical and conservation-aware: adjust only the lower-confidence side; scale by confidence gap up to 0.4 and attenuate by router imbalance; avoid re-sync on strongly scaled directions (strong_scaled flags). This protects router totals while closing residual asymmetries.
  - Confidence integrates what actually happened: base link confidence, pre/post mismatch reduction, router post-imbalance penalty, scale magnitude and clip-hit penalties, stability/share, bundle-consistency, plus final symmetry and peer smoothing (10%). This yields calibration 0.942 in the current best; Gen 98’s router/peer smoothing and scaling guards push calibration to 0.945 with similar counter.
- Soft-zero handling is conditional and topology-aware: the current best snaps tiny links to zero only if both adjacent routers are within their adaptive tau_router, preventing zeroing that would worsen conservation (also reflected in Gen 98’s “strict soft-zero handling”).

## Performance Analysis
- The 0.94 cluster is robust; differences are in counter and confidence tightness:
  - Current best: 0.94 (counter 0.936; confidence 0.942). Gen 94 matches (0.936; 0.942) with median-based bundle alignment; Gen 99 yields slightly higher counter 0.937 but lower calibration 0.935; Gen 98 reaches the best calibration 0.945 with counter 0.935. This indicates a small trade-off band between counter gains and confidence calibration depending on scaling guards and finishing choices.
  - Bundle-aware consensus variants that lean on shared-factor scaling and strict caps remain slightly behind on counter (Gen 93: 0.931; Gen 98 better at 0.935 after adding router-biased fusion and scaling guards), confirming that hybrid Hodor’s targeted scaling plus re-sync closes residuals more reliably.
- POCS-family approaches trail significantly: Gen 95 at Combined 0.83 (counter 0.837; confidence 0.785) and Gen 96 at 0.66 (counter 0.653; confidence 0.617) validate that alternating/global projections with generic WLS and light smoothing under-correct large asymmetries and miscalibrate confidence versus invariant satisfaction.
- Status repair is saturated at 1.000 across top methods; thus overall ranking is determined by counter and especially confidence calibration. Programs incorporating clip-hit/scale penalties and peer/router smoothing (current best; Gen 91/92/94/98) consistently achieve calibration ≥0.933, with the top around 0.942–0.945, while more conservative consensus pipelines sit around 0.934 and POCS variants fall well below.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Replace side selection with expected-penalty scoring and add a 70/30 split on near ties
   - For each router, compute S_tx = Σ_i (1 − conf_tx[i])·tx[i] and S_rx = Σ_i (1 − conf_rx[i])·rx[i]; pick the side with the larger S_side to adjust. If |S_tx − S_rx|/max(S_tx, S_rx) ≤ 0.10, apply 70% of the residual on the lower-penalty side, recompute, then apply the remaining 30% on the other side, keeping existing dominance caps, tier clips (1.12/1.10), and near-zero shielding. This preserves the current dominance-aware pattern but reduces concentration and clip hits in borderline cases.

2. Make bounds share- and dominance-aware and distribute the final uniform step by slack
   - Replace the fixed 0.90 floor with lb_i = min(0.97, 0.90 + 0.05·sqrt(HHI_router) + 0.05·share_i), and use lb_i across both tiers and the uniform step; keep clip highs at 1.12 (low-conf) and 1.10 (mid-conf). In the final damped pass, distribute alpha via weights w_i = (1 − conf_i)·(1 − share_i), applying alpha_i = 1 + 0.4·(alpha − 1)·w_i/Σw and capping per-interface alpha_i to [0.97, 1.03]. This protects dominant links while letting slack, low-confidence members absorb more correction, improving counter accuracy without overshoot.

3. Bias Stage 1 fusion toward router conservation in large mismatches
   - In fuse_direction’s large-mismatch branch, nudge toward the side that reduces router residuals: fused = avg + β·(target_side − avg), avg = 0.5·(v_local + v_peer), with β = min(0.4, 0.5·(((imb_a + imb_b)/tau_avg) − 1)+), where imb_r is rel_diff(Σtx_r, Σrx_r) and tau_avg is the mean tau_router of the two routers. Retain the current status/near-zero shields and snap-to-peer rules when one end is near-zero or down. This moves conservation earlier, easing Stage 2 while keeping link asymmetries where routers are already balanced.

4. Add a second, saturating re-sync micro-pass gated by tolerance and router balance
   - After the existing re-sync, identify link-directions with residual > 1.5× tau_h_dir and with both adjacent routers within their tau_router; run a second pass with halved gain and tight caps: f2 = 0.5·f_gain·min(0.20, gap
