# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the **Current Best Program** and Generations 60-69, here are the optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Stochastic Feasibility within Binary Search:** The **Current Best Program** (Score: **26.26**) secures the optimal score by embedding a robust randomized loop (50 shuffles) directly into the binary search's feasibility check. By treating the target pressure $K$ as a hard constraint and randomly retrying permutations, it forces valid packings into tighter bounds than deterministic methods can achieve.
- **Hybrid Greedy Initialization with Steepest Descent:** **Generation 62** and **Generation 65** matched the Current Best's score of **26.26** but with drastically faster execution times (0.002s and 0.014s vs. 0.097s). These programs prove that quickly generating a "good enough" placement via greedy or beam search and then repairing the bottleneck GPU using **Steepest Descent Local Search** is computationally superior to brute-force randomization.
- **Failure-Driven Prioritization:** **Generation 60**, **64**, and **68** (Score: **26.26**) successfully utilized "failure memory." These algorithms track items that fail to fit in specific packing attempts and prioritize them in subsequent iterations. This targeted adaptation resolves tight packing constraints more efficiently than blind shuffling.
- **Dynamic Constraint Linearization:** The **Current Best Program** and **Generation 65** confirm the effectiveness of transforming the non-linear KVPR objective ($w/rem \le K$) into a linear bin packing constraint ($w + K \cdot s \le K \cdot C$). This allows standard "Best Fit" heuristics to function correctly by dynamically weighting item "size" based on the current binary search target.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Weakly Coupled Local Search:** Despite using Beam Search and Local Search, **Generation 66** and **Generation 67** plateaued at **26.23**. Comparison with the successful **Generation 62** suggests that their local search phases (labeled "hill-climbing") were likely not aggressive enough or failed to specifically target the *bottleneck* GPU, getting trapped in local optima where the global maximum pressure could not be reduced further.
- **Pure Randomization Latency:** While the **Current Best Program** achieves the optimal score, its reliance on 50 random shuffles per binary search step results in high execution overhead (0.097s). Compared to **Generation 6

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the Current Best Program (Score: 26.26, Time: 0.097s) and the global insights from Generations 60-69, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Adaptive Stochastic Depth**
    Address the high execution latency (0.097s) by dynamically scaling the number of random shuffles in the binary search. Start with zero or few iterations (e.g., 5) when the binary search bounds (`high - low`) are wide, and linearly increase to the maximum (e.g., 50-100) only as the bounds converge. This focuses expensive computational resources solely on the critical phase where the distinction between feasible and infeasible $K$ is subtle.

2.  **Integrate Failure-Driven Prioritization**
    Leverage the success of Generations 60 and 64 by modifying the `try_pack` function to return indices of items that failed to fit. In the subsequent randomized iteration, strictly place these "bottleneck" items at the front of the processing queue. This creates a directed feedback loop that resolves hard constraints more efficiently than blind shuffling.

3.  **Adopt Perturbed "Noisy Heuristic" Sorting**
    Replace the purely random `rng.shuffle(indices)` with a perturbed sorting mechanism: `key = (item['w'] + k_target * item['s']) * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)`. This preserves the global structural guidance of the optimal linearization heuristic (which correlates well with good packings) while introducing enough variance to escape local optima, exploring the solution space more effectively than total randomization.

4.  **Incorporate Bottleneck-Targeted Local Search**
    Drawing from the efficiency of Generation 62, implement a **Steepest Descent** repair phase. If the greedy packing fails or finds a suboptimal solution, identify the GPU with the maximum pressure (the bottleneck) and attempt to move or swap a single model from it to another GPU. This targeted local optimization can often resolve the max-pressure constraint faster than restarting the entire packing process.

5.  **Diversify Inner Packing Strategies**
    Within the stochastic loop, randomly toggle the packing logic between "Best Fit" (minimize remaining space) and "Worst Fit" (maximize remaining space/balance load). While the current Best Fit is excellent for tight packing, Worst Fit can prevent early fragmentation of GPU memory, potentially accommodating outliers with large sizes that appear later in the sort order.
