# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the detailed analysis of Generations 50-59 and the Current Best Program, here are the optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Randomized Feasibility within Binary Search:** The most dominant high-scoring pattern (Score: **26.26**) integrates stochastic processes directly into the binary search's feasibility check. The **Current Best Program**, **Generation 51**, **52**, **54**, **55**, **57**, and **58** all utilize randomized sorting, shuffling, or "noisy" heuristics. This allows the algorithm to find valid permutations for tighter $K$ targets that deterministic sorters miss.
- **Dynamic Constraint Linearization:** The **Current Best Program**, **Generation 52**, and **Generation 54** successfully linearize the non-linear KVPR objective into a bin packing constraint: $w + K \cdot s \le K \cdot C$ (or equivalently $s + w/K \le C$). By treating $K$ (target pressure) as a constant during the feasibility check, the problem converts to a standard variable-sized bin packing problem, enabling the use of efficient "Best Fit" heuristics.
- **Tiered Feasibility Strategy:** The **Current Best Program** employs a robust "tiered" validation approach. It first attempts four computationally cheap deterministic sorts (Dynamic Weight, Size, Weight, Density). It only engages a computationally expensive loop of 50 randomized shuffles if these fail. This strategy achieves the optimal score of 26.26 while ensuring easy cases are solved instantly.
- **Bound Tightening via Actual Maxima:** A critical optimization in the **Current Best Program** is updating the binary search's upper bound (`high`) to the *actual* maximum KVPR observed in a valid placement, rather than the tested `mid` value. This technique accelerates convergence and allows the binary search to "snap" to the true optimal value.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Deterministic Beam Search:** Despite being a sophisticated search technique, **Generation 53** (Beam Search with linearized cost) plateaued at a score of **26.23**. This reinforces findings from previous generations (44, 47) that without stochastic exploration, deterministic tree-search methods get stuck in local optima and cannot find the specific permutations required to reach the 26.26 score ceiling.
- **Adaptive/Repair Logic without Randomization:** **Generation 50** ("Repair Packing") and **Generation 59** ("Adaptive Binary Search") achieved a score of **26.25**. While they outperformed standard deterministic methods (26.23), their logic to "fix" failing items or adaptively reorder based on failure history proved slightly less effective than the brute-force randomized shuffling employed by the 26.26 cohort.
- **Loose Coupling of Search and Packing:** **Generation 56** scored **26.23** despite using "stochastic bin packing." This suggests that simply adding randomness is insufficient; the randomization must be aggressively coupled with the binary search loop (as seen in Gen 51/54/57) to force the target threshold $K$ lower.

## Implementation Insights
- **Dynamic Sort Keys:** The **Current Best Program** uses a lambda function for sorting that depends on the current binary search target: `lambda x: x['w'] + k_target * x['s']`. This implementation detail dynamically adjusts the "cost" of an item based on how tight the memory constraint is at that specific iteration of the binary search.
- **Floating-Point Robustness:** The **Current Best Program** explicitly handles numerical instability by rewriting the validity check `w / rem <= K` as `w <= K * rem + 1e-9` and including guard clauses for division by zero. This prevents false negatives in feasibility checks when GPUs are perfectly filled.
- **Encapsulated Packing Logic:** High-performing implementations like the **Current Best** encapsulate the packing logic into a helper function (e.g., `try_pack`). This design pattern allows the main solver to easily switch between deterministic sorts and randomized shuffles without duplicating the complex bin-packing validation logic.

## Performance Analysis
- **The Stochastic Gap (26.23 vs 26.26):** A clear performance stratification exists. Purely deterministic programs (**Gen 53, 56**) consistently score **26.23**. Programs that introduce robust randomization during the construction phase (**Current Best, Gen 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58**) consistently score **26.26**. This 0.03 difference represents the margin between a "good" deterministic fit and an "optimal" stochastic fit.
- **The "Adaptive" Middle Ground:** Programs like **Generation 50** and **59** that use intelligent repair or adaptive weights fall exactly in the middle at **26.25**. They are better than static deterministic methods but fail to find the global optima that randomized shuffling uncovers.
- **Execution Time vs. Complexity:** While the **Current Best Program** takes 0.097s due to its robust 50-shuffle loop, other 26.26 scorers like **Generation 58** (0.006s) and **Generation 54** (0.017s) achieve the same score much faster. This implies that fewer random iterations or more targeted local search refinement (Gen 58) can achieve the same result with lower latency.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the Current Best Program and the global insights from Generations 50-59, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Implement Perturbed "Noisy Heuristic" Sorting**
    Instead of using a purely random `rng.shuffle(indices)` in the stochastic loop, sort items using the optimal linearization key multiplied by a noise factor: `key = (item['w'] + k_target * item['s']) * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)`. This strategy maintains the strong structural guidance of the "Best Fit" logic (which linearizes the objective) while introducing sufficient variance to escape local optima, exploring the high-probability solution space more efficiently than blind shuffling.

2.  **Integrate Failure-Driven Prioritization**
    Modify the `try_pack` function to return the indices of items that failed to fit. In the subsequent iteration of the randomized loop, explicitly move these "bottleneck" items to the very front of the processing queue. This creates an adaptive feedback loop that automatically identifies hard-to-place items and forces the greedy packer to accommodate them when the available capacity is highest.

3.  **Adopt a Hybrid Packing Strategy**
    Diversify the inner packing logic by toggling between "Best Fit" (minimizing remaining space) and "First Fit" or "Worst Fit" (maximizing remaining space) within the stochastic loop. While "Best Fit" is generally superior for variable-sized bin packing, "Worst Fit" can sometimes prevent early fragmentation by balancing loads, helping to fit subsequent large-weight items that would otherwise fail.

4.  **Add Asymptotic Pressure Sort Key**
    Expand the deterministic strategy tier with a non-linear key that models the KVPR objective's behavior near capacity: `lambda x: x['w'] / (GPU_MEM_SIZE - x['s'] + 1e-9)`. Unlike the current linear combinations, this key sorts items by the theoretical "pressure" they exert as the bin fills, helping to deterministically solve edge cases where items with moderate weights but large sizes cause the objective function to spike.

5.  **Implement Adaptive Stochastic Depth**
    Optimize execution speed by dynamically scaling the number of random shuffle iterations based on the binary search convergence. Use fewer iterations (e.g., 5-10) when the gap between `high` and `low` is large, and increase to a high number (e.g., 50-100) only when the bounds become tight. This focuses computational resources on the critical phase where the distinction between feasible and infeasible $K$ is most subtle, potentially reducing the runtime from 0.097s back towards 0.01s.
