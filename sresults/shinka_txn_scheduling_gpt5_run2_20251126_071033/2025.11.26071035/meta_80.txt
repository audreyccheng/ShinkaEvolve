# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy Cost-Sampled Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Greedy scheduler with a random start; at each step it samples up to 10 remaining transactions without replacement and picks the one minimizing workload.get_opt_seq_cost. The sample_rate is fixed at 1.0 (disabling random fallback), and num_seqs is ignored; costs are recomputed per candidate and a holdout list prevents within-step resampling.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.88 across 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Fixed full-sampling (1.0) and a single random restart limit exploration, which may cap optimality despite stable performance; redundant recomputation and unused variables indicate minor inefficiencies. Still, the approach reliably produces valid schedules with predictable greedy behavior.

Enhancements include VND (Or-opt, adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, 2-opt), consensus-guided LNS ruin-repair, path relinking, and a time-bounded endgame BnB; parameters adapt to problem size and a suffix-aware elite pool manages diversity.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 4.26 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Insertion/block caching significantly reduces cost evaluations and speeds local search, while endgame BnB tightens final sequences. Consensus-guided candidate focus and regret-dispersion balancing improve convergence and robustness; num_seqs provides a clear quality–time tradeoff.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name consensus_regret_beam_lns_vnd_bnb - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Regret-Driven Beam LNS Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Combines regret-based best-insertion with memoized cost and deterministic position sampling within a small, diversity-enforced beam, followed by VND local refinement, ILS perturbations, LNS destroy/repair, endgame branch-and-bound completion, and elite path relinking. Adaptive parameters and caches (sequence cost, best-two insertion, endgame) reduce evaluations and stabilize search.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 4.41 across three workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Caching and deterministic sampling notably reduced redundant evaluations and improved stability, while exact endgame enumeration improved quality when few transactions remained. Mixing cost and regret in beam expansion plus LNS/ILS and path relinking provided effective exploration at the chosen breadth (num_seqs=10).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name endgame_branch_and_bound_k8 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: PUCT MCTS + Endgame + VND Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: PUCT-style MCTS uses best-insertion derived priors with deterministic position sampling, plus exact endgame DFS with memoized BnB and an LRU-cached prefix cost oracle. It applies adaptive parameters, a best-two insertion cache with regret-aware greedy rollouts, cpuct annealing, and a light VND polish (1/2-opt, adjacent swaps, sampled reversals).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program fails validation and produces no successful result under the test harness.
- **Feedback**: Heavy search without strict time caps and reliance on external path/module resolution likely caused instability or timeouts; additionally, final schedule reconstruction uses priors instead of visit counts, weakening solution reliability. Add robust import fallbacks and hard runtime limits, and prefer visit-count-guided extraction or a deterministic greedy fallback to improve correctness and stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name puct_mcts_endgame_bb - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Regret-guided hybrid LNS scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Combines regret-based best-insertion with memoized cost evaluation and deterministic position sampling, then applies VND (adjacent swaps, Or-opt k=1–3, sampled 2-opt), ILS perturbations, LNS destroy/repair, and elite path relinking with an exact small endgame branch-and-bound. Adaptive beam/diversity control and best-two-position caching reduce evaluations and guide construction.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 4.35 on 3 workloads (300 txns), returning valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation indicates effective exploration–exploitation balance across heterogeneous workloads; memoization and bounded endgame search keep runtime predictable while enabling quality improvements. Local refinement plus LNS drives most gains, with elite maintenance and path relinking providing additional polishing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 80 - Patch Name endgame_tt_and_bidirectional_relink - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Regret-Adaptive Beam Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Multi-stage metaheuristic combining regret-adaptive beam construction with memoized best-two insertion (LRU caches for sequence cost and insertion), exact endgame DFS branch-and-bound, VND local refinement (reinsertion/or-opt, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt with don't-look bits), ILS/LNS ruin-and-repair, and elite pool with path relinking. Position sampling with stable signatures improves cache hit rates; parameters adapt to num_seqs (10 here) and the solver auto-finds the repo root for imports.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 4.35 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), generating valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization plus regret-guided construction reduced expensive evaluations and enabled deeper search; exact endgame and path relinking improved final makespan robustness. Further gains likely from tuning the beam/regret mix, cache sizes, and seeding randomness for reproducibility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 82 - Patch Name regret_beam_bnb_lns_vnd - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Regret-Guided GRASP-Beam-VND Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Hybrid pipeline combining regret-diverse GRASP construction, insertion-based beam search with one-step lookahead and suffix-2 diversity, and VND (Or-opt 3/2/1, adjacent swaps, sampled pair swaps/segment reversals) with regret-guided LNS and a final Or-opt(1) polish. Uses an LRU-cached evaluator and an EpisodeContext that caches best-two insertion positions with deterministic position sampling, plus an endgame branch-and-bound finisher; parameters adapt to instance size and search effort.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 4.27 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Best-two insertion caching and regret/diversity-guided beam expansions likely drive both solution quality and speed, while deterministic seeding improves reproducibility for evaluation. Endgame BnB helps on small remainders, and adaptive sampling/caching choices balance runtime and memory.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 83 - Patch Name endgame_bnb_completion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid Regret-Beam Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Hybrid metaheuristic combining GRASP, regret-adaptive beam search, bounded endgame BnB, VND (block-aware Or-opt), LNS (sensitivity+marginal), and bidirectional path relinking. Uses a unified best-two insertion memo with LRU (40k), golden-ratio stratified position sampling, and a suffix-3-diverse elite pool.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 4.22 on 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoized best-two evaluations and stratified position sampling significantly reduced cost evaluations, enabling deeper search within time. Endgame BnB and relinking consistently improved partial solutions to high-quality schedules, while diversity controls mitigated premature convergence.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 86 - Patch Name regret_bnb_lru - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Deterministic best-two insertion with memoization lifted the top tier. The current best Regret-Driven Beam LNS Scheduler (Gen 74, 4.41) caches best-two insertion per (sequence, txn, use_all_pos) with deterministic, suffix-seeded position sampling and anchors; similar designs in Regret-Guided Beam Search with LNS and Path Relinking (Gen 67, 4.39), GRASP Beam VND LNS Transaction Scheduler (Gen 71, 4.37), and Regret-Adaptive Beam Scheduler (Gen 82, 4.35) corroborate the gain by reducing get_opt_seq_cost calls and stabilizing construction.
- Endgame exhaustiveness/branch-and-bound consistently improves finishes. The 4.41 best flips to all-positions for small remainders and integrates an exact DFS/BnB finisher (endgame_enum_K), also used to rebuild in LNS; this pattern appears in multiple high performers (Gen 67, 4.39; Gen 82, 4.35; Gen 83, 4.27), and is absent or lighter in the lower 4.31 variant.
- Small, suffix-diverse beam guided by regret and cost. The 4.41 best uses a mixed selection (cost-ranked + high-regret quota) with suffix-2 diversity and adaptive widths; this mirrors the 4.39 (suffix-2, lookahead) and 4.37 (suffix-3) designs and correlates with scores ≥4.35.
- Layered refinement stack: VND + ILS + LNS + path relinking. Across the top programs (4.41, 4.39, 4.37, 4.35), strong VND (Or-opt 1–3, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt) followed by ILS perturbations, LNS destroy/repair, and elite path relinking is repeatedly credited as producing most of the final makespan gains.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Heavy MCTS without strict runtime controls and brittle engineering failed outright. PUCT MCTS + Endgame + VND Scheduler (Gen 77, 0.0) timed out or failed imports and extracted solutions from priors instead of visit counts, leading to no valid results despite sophisticated search.
- Consensus-guided diversification underperformed vs regret-beam. Consensus-Regret Beam Scheduling with LNS and BnB (Gen 72, 4.26) trails the regret-centric cluster (4.31–4.41), echoing earlier consensus-guided variants (Gen 70: 4.15; Gen 75: 4.20) where guidance overhead likely diluted search quality.
- Memory-heavy LRU insertion caches reduce scalability and net performance. Hybrid Regret-Beam Transaction Scheduler (Gen 86, 4.22) uses a large unified LRU (40k) and stratified sampling; despite correctness, it lags the lighter dict/memo approaches of the 4.35–4.41 group.

## Implementation Insights
- Why the current best (Gen 74, 4.41) is effective:
  - Global seq_cost cache plus best-two insertion cache shared across construction, VND, LNS, and relinking sharply cuts redundant simulator calls. Deterministic stratified position sampling (anchors at 0/mid/end/quartiles + suffix-seeded interior) boosts cache reuse while retaining guidance accuracy.
  - Endgame_optimal_completion uses BnB with regret-ordered expansion and memoization, and is reused inside LNS when the destroyed set is small—tightening completions beyond heuristic insertion. The switch to exhaustive positions at short remainders (endgame_all_pos_threshold/endgame_enum_K) adds accuracy where it matters most.
  - Beam expansion blends exploitation (by-cost) and exploration (regret quota) under suffix-2 diversity, limiting cloning and improving coverage. This mirrors the 4.39 design and aligns with its robustness across workloads.
  - Refinement stack is lightweight but effective: adjacent swaps (capped rounds), Or-opt(1–3) with focus-aware position sampling, and sampled 2-opt; ILS perturbations (swaps/block shuffles) and LNS (random/contiguous removal with regret-based repair) diversify search; path relinking aligns largest-displacement positions with a bounded move budget to harvest improvements from the elite pool.
- Concrete links to other programs:
  - The 4.39 (Gen 67) attributes gains to evaluate_best_two_positions, suffix-2 diversity, and an endgame_all_pos_threshold; the 4.41 variant adds integrated exact completion and tighter reuse of best-two during LNS, likely explaining the +0.02.
  - The 4.37 (Gen 71) emphasizes strong VND+LNS and a final OR-opt(1) polish, sharing the same core but with different parameterization and less aggressive endgame integration, consistent with its slightly lower score.
  - The 4.31 (Gen 68) has caching and deterministic sampling but lacks explicit endgame BnB and uses lighter VND, matching its relative deficit.

## Performance Analysis
- New leader: Regret-Driven Beam LNS Scheduler (Gen 74) sets a new high at 4.41, edging out the prior best 4.39 (Gen 67). The incremental gain aligns with deeper endgame search (exact BnB completion and reuse in LNS) layered on the proven regret-beam + memoization base.
- High-performing cluster (4.35–4.39) shares the same core: best-two regret insertion, global memoization, suffix-diverse beams, and layered VND/LNS/relinking (Gen 71: 4.37; Gen 80: 4.35; Gen 82: 4.35). Score differences track endgame thoroughness and refinement intensity.
- Mid-high variants (4.26–4.31) either adopt consensus guidance (Gen 72: 4.26) or have lighter endgame/refinement (Gen 68: 4.31), confirming that regret-focused beams plus exact late-stage handling are decisive.
- Reliability remains decisive: the MCTS variant (Gen 77, 0.0) demonstrates that algorithmic sophistication without strict runtime bounds and robust imports produces no measurable gains, contrasting with the consistently correct, deterministic-sampling-based implementations in the 4.22–4.41 range.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Extend best-two memoization to blocks and unify its keying across neighborhoods
   - Implement best_two_block(base_seq, block, use_all_pos=False, focus_idx=None, k_positions=None) returning (best_cost, best_pos, second_cost), and cache by (tuple(base_seq), tuple(block), pos_sig) where pos_sig is a deterministic signature of the probed positions (anchors + seeded samples), not just a boolean. Use this in reinsertion and Or-opt(2,3) in VND, and in path relinking when relocating items or short blocks, so each move evaluates only once via the memo rather than many seq_cost calls. This mirrors the top programs’ global best-two reuse and should cut simulator calls while sharpening regret guidance everywhere.

2. Make the construction beam regret-adaptive and elite-informed with late-stage suffix-3 diversity
   - At each layer, compute regret dispersion (std/mean); if high (>0.6), set high_regret_quota_ratio=0.5 and rank candidates by 0.5*best + 0.5*second, else use 0.3 and 0.8*best + 0.2*second. Form candidate txns as the union of top-k by best, top-k by regret, and top-k most misaligned to the elite median rank; when remaining <= 2×beam_width, increase beam_width by +2, switch diversity_suffix_k from 2 to 3, and flip to all positions. Seed both position and txn sampling deterministically by the sequence suffix to increase cache hits across runs and phases.

3. Tighten endgame branch-and-bound with bounded expansions and a small transposition table
   - Add a cap of ~3000 node expansions to endgame_optimal_completion and memoize subproblems by (frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix_seq[-3:])) storing the best partial cost seen to prune duplicates. Order expansions by higher regret first then lower best insertion cost, and allow K to rise to 10 if within the node cap; if the cap is hit, fall back to greedy best-two completion to remain predictable. Reuse this bounded BnB inside LNS (already done) and return the exact or near-exact completion more consistently without timeouts.

4. Upgrade VND: true 2-opt segment reversals, don’t-look bits, and best-two–guided Or-opt/reinsertion
   - Replace the current non-adjacent swap with sampled segment reversals: sample S=min(200, n) pairs (i<j), evaluate reversing seq[i:j+1], and maintain don’t-look bits per index; reset bits only around improved segments. For reinsertion and Or-opt(2,3), call best_two_insertion/best_two_block once per (item/block, base) to pick positions via regret rather than iterating many positions; use first-improvement acceptance within each neighborhood to speed convergence. These changes align with the layered VND gains seen in the ≥4.35 cluster while leveraging the best-two cache to keep it fast.

5. Strengthen elite path relinking with bidirectional moves and targeted post-PR LNS
   - Perform bidirectional relinking (source→target and target→source), order moves by largest displacement, and for each move use best_two_insertion or best_two_block to choose the best position instead of forcing the exact target index; cap moves at min(16, n//6). After each relink path, run a quick LNS polish that removes α≈0.08 of items biased to highest residual displacement versus the partner target and repairs via regret; during this polish temporarily raise diversity_suffix_k to 3. This leverages the elite pool more effectively and mirrors the refinements credited in the top-scoring programs.
