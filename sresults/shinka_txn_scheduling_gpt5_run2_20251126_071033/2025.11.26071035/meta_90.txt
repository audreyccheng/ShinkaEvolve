# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy Cost-Sampled Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Greedy scheduler with a random start; at each step it samples up to 10 remaining transactions without replacement and picks the one minimizing workload.get_opt_seq_cost. The sample_rate is fixed at 1.0 (disabling random fallback), and num_seqs is ignored; costs are recomputed per candidate and a holdout list prevents within-step resampling.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.88 across 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Fixed full-sampling (1.0) and a single random restart limit exploration, which may cap optimality despite stable performance; redundant recomputation and unused variables indicate minor inefficiencies. Still, the approach reliably produces valid schedules with predictable greedy behavior.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Deterministic best-two insertion with memoization lifted the top scores. The current best program (Regret-Driven Beam LNS Scheduler, 4.41) caches (best_cost, best_pos, second_best) per (sequence, txn, use_all_pos) and uses deterministic, suffix-seeded position sampling with anchors; similar techniques in Regret-Guided Beam + LNS Scheduler (4.39), Hybrid LNS-ILS Transaction Scheduler (4.33), and Block-Aware Best-Two Transaction Scheduler (4.31) consistently cut simulator calls and stabilized construction quality.
- Exact endgame completion via bounded branch-and-bound is decisive. The 4.41 best integrates an exact endgame BnB (≤9 tasks) ordered by regret and reuses it inside LNS rebuilds; the same endgame pattern underpins the 4.39 group (Regret-Guided Beam + LNS and Conflict-Aware Surrogate) and the 4.33 implementations, explaining their strong finishes versus lighter or absent endgame handling.
- Small regret-adaptive beams with suffix diversity prevent collapse and improve exploration. The 4.41 best runs a mixed selection (cost-ranked + regret quota) with suffix-2 diversity; comparable settings in the 4.39–4.33 cluster (Regret-Guided Beam + LNS: suffix-2; Deterministic GRASP–Beam VND/LNS: beam diversity and regret weighting) correlate with scores ≥4.31.
- Layered refinement stack (VND + ILS + LNS + path relinking) consistently polishes solutions. The 4.41 best’s VND (adjacent swaps, Or-opt 1–3, sampled 2-opt) followed by ILS perturbations, LNS ruin–repair, and path relinking mirrors high performers Hybrid Regret/VND/ILS-LNS (4.37), Deterministic GRASP–Beam VND/LNS (4.33), and Conflict-Aware Surrogate (4.39).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Heavy MCTS underperformed despite exact endgame polish. MCTS Transaction Scheduler with Endgame BnB and Polish scored 3.23: tree search overhead (PUCT, progressive widening, rollouts) diluted the benefits of endgame optimization and memoization, yielding valid but weaker schedules under the given budget.
- Consensus-guided diversification lagged regret-centric beams. Hybrid Consensus‑Regret Beam Scheduler achieved 4.20, trailing regret-driven beams (4.31–4.41). Feedback attributes overhead from consensus guidance and diversification heuristics that diluted search intensity versus regret-focused construction.
- Fragile engineering and non-determinism caused outright failure. Regret-beam LNS transaction scheduler scored 0.0 (failed validation) due to unseeded randomness and brittle repository path discovery. This contrasts with the current best’s deterministic sampling and robust path resolution logic, underscoring reliability as a performance gate.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best (4.41) effective:
  - A shared seq_cost cache plus a best-two insertion cache keyed by (tuple(seq), txn, use_all_pos) is reused across construction, LNS, and endgame. Deterministic position sampling blends anchors (0/mid/end/quartiles) with suffix-seeded interior picks, maximizing cache hits and reducing get_opt_seq_cost calls. Comparable deterministic sampling shows up in Deterministic GRASP–Beam VND/LNS (deterministic anchors/golden-ratio) and Block-Aware Best-Two (deterministic position signatures).
  - Endgame_optimal_completion uses regret-ordered BnB with memoization and flips to all positions when few remain; it’s reused inside LNS when the destroyed set is small. This deeper endgame integration aligns with the +0.02 edge over the 4.39 group that also relies on exact endgame completion but with slightly different integration.
  - Regret-adaptive beam expansion with suffix-k diversity (k=2) mixes exploitation (by-cost) and exploration (regret quota), curbing cloning and covering distinct suffixes—mirroring the methods credited in the 4.39–4.33 schedulers for avoiding beam collapse.
  - A compact yet effective refinement pipeline (adjacent swaps, Or-opt 1–3, sampled 2-opt) plus ILS perturbations and LNS destroy/repair delivers most of the final makespan gains; path relinking that aligns largest-displacement items extracts incremental improvements from elites. This stack is repeatedly cited in the 4.37–4.39 implementations as the primary post-construction improver.
- Robustness matters: the 4.41 program’s repository root discovery with fallbacks and deterministic sampling contrasts directly with the 0.0 failure’s fragile imports and randomness, reinforcing that engineering stability is prerequisite for high scores.

## Performance Analysis
- New leader at 4.41 confirms the regret-beam + memoization + endgame BnB pattern as best-in-class. The incremental gain over the 4.39 cohort (Regret-Guided Beam + LNS and Conflict-Aware Surrogate) aligns with tighter endgame integration and deterministic best-two reuse during LNS.
- The 4.33 tier (Deterministic GRASP–Beam VND/LNS; Hybrid LNS-ILS) shares the same core ideas but with lighter or differently integrated endgame and/or refinement intensity; scores trail the 4.39–4.41 group by ~0.06–0.08, indicating sensitivity to endgame thoroughness and cache-guided insertion quality.
- Block-aware and GA-based variants trail further. Block-Aware Best-Two (4.31) retains memoization/diversity but likely pays overhead for block-aware machinery and parameterization, while Memetic GA for Transaction Scheduling (4.22) benefits from VND but converges slower and to weaker makespans than regret-beam constructions.
- MCTS (3.23) and consensus-guided hybrids (4.20) underperform regret-centric beams despite incorporating endgame optimization or caching. The consistent pattern is that regret-driven insertion beams with deterministic best-two memoization and an exact endgame finisher dominate across workloads, provided the implementation is deterministic and robust.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Extend best-two memoization to blocks and reuse it across VND and path relinking
   - Implement best_two_block(base_seq, block, use_all_pos=False, focus_idx=None, k_positions=None) → (best_cost, best_pos, second_cost) and cache by (tuple(base_seq), tuple(block), pos_sig), where pos_sig is a deterministic signature of the probed positions (anchors + suffix-seeded interior samples). Replace try_reinsertion and try_or_opt with single calls to best_two_insertion/best_two_block per (item/block, base) instead of iterating positions, and in path_relink choose the best insertion position via best_two_insertion instead of forcing target index. This aligns with the top programs’ global best-two reuse and will cut simulator calls while sharpening regret guidance across neighborhoods.

2. Make the construction beam regret-adaptive, suffix-deterministic, and elite-informed with late suffix-3 diversity
   - At each layer, compute regret dispersion (std/mean); if high (>0.6), set high_regret_quota_ratio=0.5 and rank by 0.5*best + 0.5*second, else use 0.3 and 0.8*best + 0.2*second. Form candidate txns as the union of top-k by best, top-k by regret, and top-k most misaligned to the elite median rank; when remaining <= 2×beam_width, increase beam_width by +2, switch diversity_suffix_k from 2 to 3, and flip to all positions. Seed both txn and position sampling deterministically by the sequence suffix (use random.Random(hash(tuple(seq[-10:]) + (layer,)) & 0xffffffff)) to increase cache hits and stability.

3. Tighten endgame branch-and-bound with bounded expansions and a small transposition table
   - Add a cap of ~3000 node expansions in endgame_optimal_completion and memoize subproblems by (frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix_seq[-3:])) storing the best partial cost seen to prune duplicates. Order expansions by higher regret then lower best insertion cost, allow K to rise to 10 if within the node cap, and if the cap is hit, fall back to greedy best-two completion to remain predictable. Reuse this bounded BnB inside LNS when the destroyed set is small to secure more exact finishes without timeouts.

4. Upgrade VND: true 2-opt segment reversals, don’t-look bits, and best-two–guided Or-opt/reinsertion
   - Add a real 2-opt neighborhood that reverses segments: sample S=min(200, n) pairs (i<j), evaluate reversing seq[i:j+1], and accept first improvement; maintain don’t-look bits per index and reset bits only around improved segments. For reinsertion and Or-opt(2,3), call best_two_insertion/best_two_block once per (item/block, base) with deterministic position signatures, replacing inner loops over positions. This mirrors the layered VND gains in the top scorers and leverages the memo to keep it fast.

5. Strengthen LNS and path relinking with structure-aware destroys, regret-biased repairs, and post-PR polish
   - Add destroy operators beyond random/block: (a) k-regret removal (remove items with highest current regret = second-best − best), and (b) displacement-biased removal relative to the best elite partner; choose operators via suffix-seeded RNG for determinism. During repair, interleave picks by best and by regret; if the removed set size <= K, invoke the upgraded endgame BnB. Make path relinking bidirectional (source→target and target→source), order moves by largest displacement, choose positions via best_two_insertion/best_two_block, cap moves at min(16, n//6), and after each relink run a quick LNS polish that destroys ~8% of items (suffix-3 diversity on) to extract incremental gains.
