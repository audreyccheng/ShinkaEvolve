# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy Cost-Sampled Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Greedy scheduler with a random start; at each step it samples up to 10 remaining transactions without replacement and picks the one minimizing workload.get_opt_seq_cost. The sample_rate is fixed at 1.0 (disabling random fallback), and num_seqs is ignored; costs are recomputed per candidate and a holdout list prevents within-step resampling.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.88 across 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Fixed full-sampling (1.0) and a single random restart limit exploration, which may cap optimality despite stable performance; redundant recomputation and unused variables indicate minor inefficiencies. Still, the approach reliably produces valid schedules with predictable greedy behavior.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Deterministic best-two insertion with cross-phase memoization is the decisive driver at the top end. The current best program (Combined score 4.41) caches (best_cost, best_pos, second_best) per (tuple(seq), txn, use_all_pos) and uses deterministic anchors plus suffix-seeded interior positions, reusing these results across beam construction, LNS repair, and endgame enumeration. Similar memoized best-two designs in the 4.39 group—Regret-beam VND/LNS transaction scheduler with caching (4.39), Regret-Beam ILS/LNS Transaction Scheduler (4.39), and bnb_endgame_pruning (4.39)—consistently reduced simulator calls and stabilized quality.
- Exact endgame completion via bounded BnB, ordered by regret, closes the last gap. The 4.41 leader enumerates ≤9 remaining tasks with branch-and-bound and reuses this inside LNS when the destroyed set is small; this exact tail finisher underpins the 4.39–4.37 cohort as well (e.g., endgame_branch_and_bound at 4.27 and endgame_besttwo_and_stronger_2opt at 4.37), explaining the step up from lighter or absent endgame handling.
- Small regret-adaptive beams with suffix diversity prevent collapse and balance exploration/exploitation. The best program mixes by-cost and by-regret selection with a ~30% regret quota and suffix-2 diversity; the same beam pattern appears in the 4.39 cluster and the 4.37–4.26 variants (e.g., txn_sched_beam_lookahead_vnd_lns_pr at 4.37, bnb_greedy_insert_relink_block_and_cache_bump at 4.26), correlating with higher scores than non-beam approaches.
- Layered refinement (VND + ILS + LNS + path relinking) consistently polishes solutions. The 4.41 leader’s VND (adjacent swaps, Or-opt 1–3, sampled 2-opt), ILS perturbations, sensitivity-guided LNS with endgame reuse, and displacement-based path relinking mirrors the primary post-construction improvers cited in the 4.39 and 4.37 implementations.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Fragile engineering and nondeterminism cause outright failure. The Regret-beam LNS scheduler (0.0, failed validation) suffered from brittle repository path resolution and nondeterministic search, plus an insertion-oracle cache that ignored focus_idx/k_override in its keys, leading to incorrect reuse. In contrast, the 4.41 best includes robust repo-root discovery and deterministic position sampling to keep caches sound.
- Heavy MCTS overhead under fixed budgets underperforms. MCTS Scheduler with Progressive Widening (3.61) paid for tree machinery (UCB, PW, rollouts) while only modestly polishing with local search; the overhead diluted the benefits from caching and endgame optimization relative to regret-beam constructors.
- GA-centric search converges slower than regret-beam builders. The Memetic GA with BnB Tail (4.17) leveraged VND and a bounded BnB suffix to reach valid schedules, but it lagged the 4.26–4.41 regret-beam family due to slower convergence and weaker construction quality under the same time budgets.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the 4.41 best effective:
  - Best-two insertion cache keyed by (sequence, txn, use_all_pos) plus deterministic anchors and suffix-seeded interior sampling maximizes cache hits and ensures reuse across beam, LNS, and endgame. Since best_two_insertion is only called without focus_idx/k_positions, the cache key remains sound and avoids the incorrect reuse bug seen in the failing 0.0 program.
  - Endgame BnB is tightly integrated: ≤9 remaining tasks, regret-ordered branching, and reuse inside LNS when destroyed sets are small. This deeper integration aligns with the +0.02 edge over the 4.39 cohort that also employ endgame completion.
  - Beam selection mixes exploitation (by-cost rank) with exploration (regret quota) and suffix-2 diversity, preventing beam collapse into clones—a pattern repeatedly cited in the 4.39–4.37 schedulers.
  - A compact refinement stack (adjacent swaps, Or-opt 1–3, sampled 2-opt) plus ILS/LNS and displacement-based path relinking provides most of the final gains with controlled overhead; similar stacks are credited in txn_sched_beam_lookahead_vnd_lns_pr (4.37), besttwo_endgame_vnd_pr (4.39), and bnb_endgame_pruning (4.39).
- Robustness patterns that matter:
  - Deterministic seeding of position sampling and robust repository root discovery prevent flakiness. The 4.41 best includes multiple root fallbacks and deterministic interior sampling, in contrast with the 0.0 failure’s brittle path resolution and nondeterministic search that broke validation.
  - Exact positions for small sequences and use_all_pos for small remainders improve accuracy where it matters, while sampled positions control cost elsewhere; this trade-off appears across top programs and supports both construction and endgame efficiency.

## Performance Analysis
- The 4.41 leader confirms the regret-beam + deterministic best-two + exact endgame pattern as best-in-class. Its small edge over the 4.39 group is consistent with tighter endgame reuse during LNS and deterministic best-two reuse during rebuilds.
- Programs clustering at 4.39 (Regret-beam VND/LNS with caching; Regret-Beam ILS/LNS Transaction Scheduler; bnb_endgame_pruning) share the same core mechanics—memoized best-two insertion, suffix-diverse beams, exact endgame, and layered refinement—indicating the approach’s robustness across implementations.
- Strengthening endgame and best-two usage shows clear score lifts within the same family. The Hybrid Regret-LNS Transaction Scheduler rose from 4.27 (endgame_branch_and_bound) to 4.37 (endgame_besttwo_and_stronger_2opt) after adding stronger 2-opt and best-two reuse, quantifying the impact of more thorough tail optimization and better insertion oracles.
- Non-regret constructors trail under the same budgets: GA-based (4.17) and MCTS (3.61) variants lag the 4.26–4.41 regret-beam cohort despite endgame and caching, underscoring that regret-driven insertion beams with deterministic best-two memoization and exact endgame completion deliver the most consistent makespan reductions given the available time.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Extend best-two memoization to blocks and reuse it in VND and path relinking
   - Implement best_two_block(base_seq, block, use_all_pos=False, k_positions=None) → (best_cost, best_pos, second_best_cost) and cache by (tuple(base_seq), tuple(block), use_all_pos, pos_sig), where pos_sig is a deterministic signature of the probed positions (anchors + suffix-seeded interior). Replace the inner loops in try_reinsertion and try_or_opt with a single call to best_two_insertion/best_two_block per (item/block, base), and in path_relink choose the insertion position via best_two_insertion instead of forcing target index. This mirrors the 4.41 pattern, slashes simulator calls during VND/PR, and sharpens regret guidance across neighborhoods.

2. Make the construction beam regret-adaptive, suffix-deterministic, and late-diverse
   - At each layer, compute regret dispersion over expansions (std/mean of second − best); if high (>0.6), set high_regret_quota_ratio=0.5 and rank by 0.5*best + 0.5*regret, else keep 0.3 and 0.8*best + 0.2*regret. Seed candidate txn sampling deterministically with rng = random.Random(hash((tuple(seq[-10:]), layer, len(rem))) & 0xffffffff) and, when remaining <= 2×local_beam_width, widen the beam by +2, switch diversity_suffix_k from 2 to 3, and flip use_all_pos=True for positions. This increases cache hits, prevents beam collapse, and aligns with the top programs’ stable construction behavior.

3. Tighten endgame branch-and-bound with bounded expansions and a small transposition table
   - Add a node cap ~3000 in endgame_optimal_completion and a transposition table keyed by (frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix_seq[-3:])) storing the best partial cost seen; prune when revisiting with ≥ best. Order branches by higher regret then lower best insertion cost, and allow K to rise to 10 so long as the node cap isn’t hit; if the cap is exceeded, fall back to greedy best-two completion for predictability. Reuse this bounded BnB inside LNS when the removed set is small, matching the decisive exact-tail integration seen in the 4.41–4.39 cohort.

4. Upgrade VND with true 2-opt segment reversals, don’t-look bits, and best-two–guided reinsertion/Or-opt
   - Replace the current sampled swap with proper 2-opt segment reversals: sample S=min(200, n) pairs (i<j), evaluate reversing seq[i:j+1], accept first improvement, and maintain don’t-look bits per index, resetting only around improved segments. For reinsertion and Or-opt(2,3), call best_two_insertion/best_two_block once per (item/block) using deterministic pos_sig instead of iterating positions, and stop at first improvement; this keeps the search fast via memo reuse and provides the stronger polishing that lifted similar programs from 4.27 to 4.37.

5. Strengthen LNS and path relinking with structure-aware destroys, regret-biased repairs, and post-PR polish
   - Add destroy operators beyond random/block: (a) k-regret removal (highest current regret = second − best), and (b) displacement-biased removal vs the elite best; choose operator and items via suffix-seeded RNG for determinism. During repair, interleave picks by best and by regret (e.g., alternate steps or set regret_prob via dispersion), invoke the bounded endgame BnB when |removed| <= K, and make path relinking bidirectional (source→target and target→source) choosing positions via best_two_insertion; cap moves at min(16, n//6). After each relink, run a quick LNS polish destroying ~8% of items with suffix-3 diversity to extract incremental gains.
