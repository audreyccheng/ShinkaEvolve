# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy sampled transaction scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Implements a greedy cost-sampling scheduler: start at a random transaction, then at each step evaluate up to 10 randomly selected candidates via workload.get_opt_seq_cost and pick the minimum; sample_rate is fixed at 1.0 so only the greedy path runs. Includes robust repo-root path discovery; num_seqs and workload_size are unused, costs are recomputed redundantly, and randomness is unseeded.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.65 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); correct and passes all validation tests with execution time recorded.
- **Feedback**: Greedy sampling trades optimality for speed; unseeded randomness can cause variability—seeding or multi-start runs could stabilize/improve scores. Removing redundant cost recomputations and honoring num_seqs/sample_rate would reduce overhead and enable broader exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam-search transaction scheduler with memoized costs**
- **Implementation**: Uses beam search with dynamic beam/branch sizing, memoized prefix cost evaluation, and multiple random restarts. Initializes the beam from sampled singletons and prunes to top unique prefixes at each depth to control breadth.
- **Performance**: Combined score 3.40; produced valid schedules for all three workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Dynamic sizing and memoization reduced search overhead, while random restarts improved robustness; capped beam (≤32) and branch (≤24) factors kept runtime reasonable but can miss global optima due to stochastic pruning. Re-evaluating final schedules confirmed consistency of reported makespans.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name beam_search_with_memoized_costs - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam + local search transaction scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses a beam search with memoized partial-cost evaluations (Workload.get_opt_seq_cost) and adaptive beam width (from num_seqs) plus sampled candidate expansions, followed by local improvements via adjacent swaps and sampled insertion. Includes robust repository path discovery to import simulator/workloads reliably.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.19 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization and controlled branching reduce simulator calls and help meet the time budget, while local improvements further lower makespan beyond the beam result. Randomized starts and sampling introduce run-to-run variance without a fixed seed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name beam_search_local_improve - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-start Greedy Scheduler with Lookahead and Local Search**
- **Implementation**: Uses a multi-start greedy constructor with full candidate evaluation, limited two-step lookahead, and a memoized cost cache. Final schedules are refined via adjacent-swap hill climbing and accept-if-better random insertions, with starts seeded from lowest-cost singletons.
- **Performance**: Combined score 3.40 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization and lookahead improve selection quality and reduce redundant cost calls, while local search finds additional improvements after greedy construction. Runtime is mitigated by sampling and bounded local moves, though full candidate evaluation per step remains a potential bottleneck on larger instances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name greedy_full_eval_beam_local - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Tournament-ILS Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Builds a pairwise preference matrix from O(n^2) length-1/2 simulations to score transactions and locally sort via tournament comparisons, then applies memoized true-cost refinement with one adjacent-swap pass, limited ruin-and-recreate (sampled insert positions), and sampled insertion moves; refinement budget scales with num_seqs. A cached evaluator avoids redundant simulator calls across candidates.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.87 on 3 workloads (300 transactions); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Pairwise surrogate costs provided strong ordering signals and reduced expensive evaluations, with memoization further decreasing simulator calls. The constrained ILS budget (single true-cost pass and up to two ruin-and-recreate tries) likely caps peak optimality while keeping runtime controlled.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name pairwise_tournament_rank_ils - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: MCTS + VND Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: UCT-based MCTS over partial schedules with progressive widening, greedy-biased expansion, cost caching, and a transposition table; rollouts use limited lookahead with pruning and are followed by VND local search (adjacent swaps, insertions, small block moves). The final schedule is extracted via most-visited children with greedy fallback, and evaluated across three workloads.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 0.0; did not pass validation.
- **Feedback**: Failures likely stem from nondeterminism (no fixed RNG seed), heavy iteration budgets causing timeouts, and brittle repo path discovery; partial-cost reliance may also mismatch the simulator API. Seed the RNG, cap/scale iteration budgets, simplify imports to avoid filesystem probing, and verify partial-cost calls against the provided Workload interface.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name uct_mcts_vnd_scheduler - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hybrid Beam-GRASP Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Alternates a beam search with shallow lookahead and a GRASP constructor, using adaptive beam/branch sizes scaled by N and a shared memoized cost cache under a 0.35s per-workload time budget. A local search phase (adjacent swaps, random swaps, sampled insertions) refines each constructed sequence.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.56 on 3 workloads (300 transactions) within the time budget, and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The hybrid construction plus local improvement consistently finds low-makespan schedules under tight time constraints, aided by caching and adaptive sampling. Beam truncation with greedy completion can occur when the budget is tight, but outputs remain valid.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name beam_grasp_ils_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-start Greedy VNS Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized partial-sequence evaluator with multi-start greedy construction (limited lookahead) and Variable Neighborhood Search combining adjacent swaps, sampled relocations, and light ruin-and-recreate; seeding is diversified via singleton-cost rankings and budgets adapt to problem size. Includes adaptive candidate sampling and restart strategies to control simulator calls and runtime.
- **Performance**: Combined score 3.24 across three workloads (300 transactions); produced valid schedules and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization significantly cuts simulator evaluations, enabling stronger local search within the given budget, while adaptive sampling and restrained ruin-and-recreate maintain good makespan-quality/runtime trade-offs. Time-based RNG seeding yields non-deterministic results across runs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name greedy_lookahead_rr_vns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Marginal-Cost LNS Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Employs a marginal-cost-guided LNS: a lazy candidate-pool greedy constructor with limited lookahead builds seeds, a global cost cache accelerates evals, adjacent-swap hill-climb cleans up, and hot windows (chosen via prefix marginals) are reordered using budgeted permutation enumeration/sampling; targeted relocate moves, multi-start seeding, and final random insertions provide additional refinement.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.18 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation indicates robust correctness and effective heuristic improvements from caching and windowed LNS/relocate moves; the score suggests remaining headroom, potentially addressable via adaptive pool/window sizes or dynamic permutation budgets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name marginal_lns_pool - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Greedy VNS Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses pairwise-tournament-guided greedy construction with limited lookahead and a global memoized cost cache. Precomputes singleton/pairwise costs to form preference margins, applies multi-start seeding, and refines schedules via VNS (tournament bubble cleanup, adjacent swaps, relocations, non-adjacent swaps, and ruin-and-recreate).
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.12 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Precomputing pairwise preferences and caching partial evaluations effectively cut simulator calls and guided the search toward low-conflict orderings. Multi-start plus VNS consistently improved makespan, and size-aware budgeting maintained stable performance across varying workload complexities.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name pairwise_guided_greedy_vns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Preference-Guided Beam Search Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized cost oracle and a sampled pairwise preference model to compute soft precedence weights, guiding a time-bounded beam search scored by true cost plus penalty with shallow lookahead and adaptive beam/branch sizes. A multi-pass LocalRefiner fixes high-weight violations, then performs adjacent swaps, random insertions, and long swaps, with a SchedulerEngine allocating time across preference building, construction, and refinement per workload size.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.04 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests within the ~0.75s/workload budget.
- **Feedback**: Preference sampling and cost memoization effectively reduce search overhead, while lookahead and violation-guided refinement yield consistent makespan improvements. Dynamic scaling and ALNS-style moves aid solution quality, though the modest score indicates potential gains from deeper lookahead or broader restart strategies under the same time budget.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name pref_beam_alns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam search scheduler with caching and refinement**
- **Implementation**: Time-bounded beam search using marginal-cost ordering and shallow lookahead, with shared memoization caches (cost/delta), incumbent-based pruning, greedy completion, and a local improvement pass (adjacent swaps plus random insertions). Beam/branch widths scale with workload size and multiple restarts run within the budget.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.93 across 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Caching and marginal-cost ordering reduce redundant evaluations and focus exploration, while shallow lookahead and greedy completion tighten pruning against the incumbent. The lightweight local refinement yields incremental gains without exceeding the per-workload time budget.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name beam_astar_delta_local - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: A*-beam scheduler with memoized delta costs**
- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-guided beam search with delta-based candidate ordering, greedy two-step lookahead completion, and local polishing (adjacent swaps and sampled insertions). A shared CostOracle memoizes cost and marginal deltas with FIFO-bounded caches, plus multi-profile restarts and adaptive beam/branching from num_seqs.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; failed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Time-salted RNG seeds and brittle repository path discovery undermine determinism and portability, likely contributing to test failures. The max-singleton lower bound used as f=max(g,h) is not clearly admissible for the remaining cost, risking incorrect pruning and invalid results; additionally, the “partial sampling” branches are no-ops, reducing intended speedups.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name astar_beam_lns_scheduler - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: A*-guided Beam + Local Search Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-guided beam search with cached sequence costs and marginal deltas, a singleton-cost lower bound, diversified seeding, candidate sampling, two-step lookahead, periodic greedy completions, and multi-restart local search (adjacent swaps and relocations) with shared caches and deterministic RNG. Includes repo-root probing to import external simulator/workloads and aggregates makespan across three workloads.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program failed validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Likely failure stems from brittle external path discovery/imports and/or oversized beam/branch settings causing timeouts; the singleton-based lower bound may be too weak to prune effectively. Additionally, ‘workload_size’ is unused and restarts share the same RNG stream, reducing diversity and potential solution quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name beam_astar_delta_vns - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: A*-guided beam scheduler with local refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-style marginal-cost beam search with shared cost/delta caches, lightweight lookahead, incumbent pruning, greedy completion, and a bounded local improvement phase (adjacent swaps and limited insertions) under a 0.60s per-workload time budget and deterministic multi-mode restarts. It also includes custom repository path discovery and sys.path injection to import the simulator and workloads.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program is marked incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Fragile import path discovery and strict time budgeting likely caused failures or fallback to low-quality/random schedules, leading to validation failure. The heuristic (max singleton as lower bound) and non-additive g-cost may misguide the beam/A* scoring, further hurting solution quality under tight time limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name astar_marginal_beam - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Memoized Beam Search Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Implements a time-bounded, dynamic-width beam search that ranks candidates by marginal cost with shallow lookahead, periodically greedily completes prefixes to tighten the incumbent, and deduplicates prefixes. Shared memoized cost caches span restarts, and a local improvement pass (adjacent swaps plus random insertions) refines the final sequence.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.48 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests within the per-workload 0.55s budget.
- **Feedback**: Cache reuse and greedy completion reduce redundant evaluations and enable effective pruning under the tight time cap, improving schedule quality. Dynamic beam sizing and local refinement balance exploration and exploitation, though the strict 0.55s budget can limit the number of effective restarts on larger instances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name precedence_guided_beam_with_lookahead_and_local_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Time-bounded memoized beam scheduler with local search**
- **Implementation**: Combines adaptive beam search with memoized marginal-cost evaluation and shallow lookahead under a strict time budget. Prefixes are greedily completed with incumbency pruning, then refined by adjacent swaps and sampled insertions across restarts.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.83 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); schedules are valid and all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Caching of full sequence costs and prefix-extension pairs reduces simulator calls and enables near real-time search, yielding strong makespan within tight budgets. Randomized candidate sampling and restarts introduce variability but help escape local minima; ext_cost recomputes full costs rather than true deltas, which may cap scalability on larger N.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name beam_marginal_memo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam A*-guided Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Implements beam search with A*-style lower bounds, marginal-cost ordering, shallow lookahead, and greedy multi-prefix completion; shared memoized cost/extension caches across restarts and precomputed singleton costs reduce evaluation overhead. A post-beam local-improvement phase (adjacent swaps, sliding-window insertions, bounded random insertions) refines schedules, with dynamic beam/branch sizing and a 0.55s/workload time budget.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.28; produced valid schedules for 3 workloads (300 transactions) within the time budget and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Lower-bound pruning plus memoization cut redundant evaluations and accelerate convergence, while sliding-window refinement improves makespan beyond greedy completion. Time-bounded restarts and incumbent tightening via greedy finishes yield robust results, with minor variability due to randomized sampling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name a_star_lb_beam_and_window_local - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Beam Search with VNS for Scheduling**
- **Implementation**: Builds a tournament preference matrix from memoized singleton/pairwise costs and runs a beam search with lookahead, tournament-based candidate preselection, diverse starts, and state deduplication. A VNS post-optimizer applies tournament bubble passes, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocations, and ruin-and-recreate, leveraging caching to limit simulator calls.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.41 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization and tournament-guided pruning effectively balance exploration and evaluation cost, yielding strong schedules with a modest beam width. Local VNS refinements reliably improve beam outputs; tuning beam and candidate parameters may further boost results on conflict-heavy workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name tournament_guided_beam_vns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: A*-Guided Beam Scheduler with Greedy Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a time-budgeted A*-guided beam search using marginal-cost ordering, singleton lower-bound pruning, shallow lookahead, and shared memoized cost caches across restarts with dynamic beam/branch sizing. Beam prefixes are greedily completed to tighten the incumbent and then locally refined via adjacent swaps, insertions, and sparse long swaps.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.07 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Shared caches and LB pruning reduce cost evaluations and help maintain quality under the 0.55s/workload budget; dynamic beam/branching and periodic greedy completion quickly establish strong incumbents. Local refinement yields modest extra gains, but results remain somewhat sensitive to randomness and tight time limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name a_star_lb_prune_and_multi_finish - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: MCTS+LNS Conflict-Aware Txn Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Combines MCTS with epsilon-greedy, conflict-biased rollouts and a ruin-and-recreate LNS refinement under a strict time budget. Employs memoized cost caches (full, extension, pairwise, singleton) and sampled conflict weights to guide expansion, rollout, removal, reinsertion, and light swap polishing.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.0 and failed validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Repo path discovery via find_repo_root (using __file__ and hardcoded fallbacks) is brittle and likely caused import/runtime failures; nondeterminism (no seeding) and tight time budgets can yield inconsistent or weak schedules, triggering fallbacks. Stabilize imports, add deterministic seeding, and reassess time allocation to improve robustness and pass validations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name mcts_lns_hybrid - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Tournament-guided beam search with VNS refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized partial evaluator with precomputed singleton/pairwise costs to build preference margins, then runs a multi-restart beam search with incumbent pruning, buddy-list lookahead, and tournament-based candidate preselection. A local improvement phase applies violation-focused adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocate moves, and ruin-and-recreate; RNG is seeded for determinism and repository path resolution is handled via a custom finder.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 0.0; the program failed validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Failures likely stem from brittle repo path detection or reliance on partial-sequence evaluation (get_opt_seq_cost) that may not match the expected API, leading to incorrect results. Aggressive pruning and heavy O(n^2) precomputation may also hurt robustness/performance on some workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name beam_multirestart_incumbent_buddies - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Lookahead Greedy TXN Scheduler with Local Search**
- **Implementation**: Implements a time-bounded, memoized greedy constructor with restricted candidate lists and two-step lookahead, multi-start seeding from best singletons plus random seeds, and a local search phase (adjacent swaps and random insertions). Uses caching of sequence and extension costs and attempts auto-discovery of import paths.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; failed validation.
- **Feedback**: Likely failures stem from unseeded randomness and time-based control causing nondeterministic outputs, and brittle path-hacking for imports that may break in the evaluator. Fix imports, seed the RNG, and replace time-based limits with deterministic iteration bounds to satisfy validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name memoized_lookahead_greedy_ils - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Greedy-VNS Transaction Scheduler with Adaptive Lookahead**
- **Implementation**: Multi-start greedy construction (10 restarts) with deterministic per-workload RNG, memoized sequence-costs, incumbent pruning, and adaptive lookahead over top candidates; followed by VNS-style local improvement (adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, insertion, targeted high-marginal relocations, and light ruin-and-recreate with greedy reinsertion). Robust repo-root discovery and seeding ensure reproducibility and stable imports.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.40 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Incumbent pruning and caching reduce redundant evaluations, while adaptive lookahead and targeted relocations improve makespan quality; deterministic seeding yields consistent, repeatable outcomes. The balance of randomized restarts with focused local refinements provides strong correctness with dependable performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam-guided memoized transaction scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses beam search with adaptive beam/branching, one-step lookahead, and early incumbent tightening, supported by memoized prefix/extension costs. Completes prefixes via greedy marginal-cost selection, then applies local refinement (adjacent swaps and random insertions) with multiple restarts under a per-workload time budget (0.65s).
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.02 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests within the set time budget.
- **Feedback**: Caching and marginal-cost lookahead improved pruning and reduced expensive evaluations; restarts enhanced exploration. The shallow lookahead and fixed time cap likely cap peak quality for larger N but delivered consistent, timely solutions here.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name beam_memo_local_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Cluster-guided MCTS Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Uses MCTS with UCT, memoized cost calls, pairwise cost matrix (M), W-margins, tournament ordering, conflict clustering (|W| 70th percentile), buddy lists, W/cluster-guided rollouts, incumbent pruning via prefix “lower bounds,” multi-restarts, and a final adjacent-swap polish. Path bootstrapping attempts to locate the example repo dynamically before importing workloads/simulator.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails validation tests and yields incorrect results.
- **Feedback**: Reliance on get_opt_seq_cost for partial prefixes (used for lb, M, W) likely violates simulator assumptions, making pruning unsafe and schedules invalid. Heavy O(n^2) precomputation of M/W contradicts the intended “few simulator calls” design and may hurt runtime; ensure valid lower bounds or restrict to full-sequence evaluations and harden path discovery to pass tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name mcts_clustered_ucb - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Tournament beam search with VNS refinement**
- **Implementation**: Builds singleton/pairwise cost matrices to derive a tournament preference order, then runs a deterministic multi-restart beam search with memoized evaluations, incumbent pruning, buddy-guided lookahead, and periodic greedy completions; the best sequence is refined by a VNS applying tournament cleanups, swaps, relocations, and ruin-and-recreate. It uses a global cost cache, diverse seeded starts, and custom repo-path discovery to load workloads.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The algorithm evaluates partial prefixes with get_opt_seq_cost (e.g., [i], [i, j]), which may violate the simulator’s contract and lead to invalid costs/schedules; ensure pruning/metrics use APIs that support prefixes or evaluate only full permutations. The custom path probing is brittle in test environments—stabilize imports and add schedule validity checks before reporting results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: GRASP Micro-Beam Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Hybrid GRASP with randomized greedy RCL and micro-beam intensification, time-bounded multi-starts, and memoized cost/extension caches for true marginal-cost evaluation. Seeds from top singletons/pairs with adaptive candidate pools and RCL by depth, followed by local refinement (adjacent swaps, 2-opt, insertions) and permutation repair.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.43 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Caching and adaptive sampling cut evaluations and stabilized quality under a tight ~0.36s+N-scaled budget; micro-beam and local search consistently improved greedy builds. Additional time could be leveraged by deeper beams or richer neighborhoods for further gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name grasp_beam_hybrid_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Tournament-guided VNS Transaction Scheduler**
- **Implementation**: Builds schedules via tournament-guided greedy with buddy-list lookahead over memoized simulator costs, using precomputed singleton/pairwise matrices and preference margins. Refines solutions with a VNS combining tournament cleanup, adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, targeted relocations, and light ruin‑and‑recreate across multi-start seeds with deterministic RNG.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.03 on three workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Pairwise-preference seeding plus memoized evaluations effectively reduce simulator calls and focus search, while VNS post-optimization further lowers makespan. Deterministic runs and diversified restarts produce stable, high-quality schedules under modest exploration budgets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name tournament_guided_buddy_lookahead - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Beam Search with VNS for Txn Scheduling**
- **Implementation**: Uses sampled pairwise preference margins to build conflict clusters and buddy lists, then runs a deterministic multi-restart beam search with shared memoization and greedy completions, followed by VNS local refinement guided by a surrogate boundary-margin score. Caches sequence and extension costs, caps pairwise probes, and allocates a fixed per-workload time budget to bound runtime.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.30 on 3 workloads (300 transactions); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic seeding and caching stabilized quality and reduced evaluations under tight time budgets; clustering and buddy-biased candidate pools effectively narrowed the search to yield good schedules quickly. Note: the num_seqs parameter is unused, and the probe cap/weak LB may trade optimality for speed on larger instances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name clustered_beam_vns - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Tournament-guided beam search plus structured VNS delivered the top score. The current best program (Tournament-guided beam search with lookahead and VNS; 3.41) precomputes pairwise costs M[i][j] and margins W to guide:
  - Tournament-based candidate preselection focused on recent conflicts,
  - A bounded beam with shallow lookahead (top-3, next-5) and greedy completions,
  - A layered VNS (tournament bubble, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocations, ruin-and-recreate), all backed by a unified memoized evaluator.
  This improves slightly over a strong non-tournament greedy+VNS baseline (Greedy‑VNS Transaction Scheduler with Adaptive Lookahead; 3.40).
- Unified memoized partial-cost evaluation is a consistent enabler. The best program caches get_opt_seq_cost for prefixes and uses it across precomputation (singleton/pairwise), beam ranking, lookahead, and all local-search moves. Similar cache-centric designs underpin other correct high scorers: Tournament‑guided VNS Transaction Scheduler (3.03), Deterministic Beam Search with VNS for Txn Scheduling (2.30), Beam‑guided memoized transaction scheduler (2.02), and GRASP Micro‑Beam Transaction Scheduler (2.43).
- Bounded lookahead and diversified, adaptive construction improve pruning and exploration. Shallow lookahead over a preselected candidate pool (lookahead_top ~3, next_k ~5) and diversified starts (tournament-best, good singleton, randomized distinct) tighten scoring and maintain diversity. Comparable patterns appear in Beam‑guided memoized (2.02) and Deterministic Beam + VNS (2.30), though with shallower beams or stricter time caps.
- Post‑construction VNS reliably improves beam/greedy outputs. Programs that include adjacent swaps plus sampled non‑adjacent swaps/relocations and lightweight ruin‑and‑recreate consistently score higher: current best (3.41), Greedy‑VNS Adaptive Lookahead (3.40), Tournament‑guided VNS (3.03), and GRASP Micro‑Beam (2.43).

## Ineffective Approaches
- MCTS variants with unsafe pruning and heavy precomputation failed outright. MCTS+LNS Conflict‑Aware Txn Scheduler (0.0) and Cluster‑guided MCTS Transaction Scheduler (0.0) relied on prefix costs for lower bounds or conflict matrices in ways that “likely violate simulator assumptions,” and layered O(n^2) precomputation on top of MCTS overhead, leading to validation failures and runtime fragility.
- Brittle repository path resolution and unseeded randomness caused 0.0 scores. Several programs failed validation due to path/import fragility and nondeterminism: Tournament‑guided beam search with VNS refinement (Gen21; 0.0), Lookahead Greedy TXN Scheduler with Local Search (Gen22; 0.0), Tournament beam search with VNS (Gen26; 0.0), and MCTS+LNS (Gen20; 0.0). Feedback points to brittle repo discovery and time-based control without deterministic seeding.
- Overaggressive pruning and mismatched API usage led to incorrect results. Programs that applied get_opt_seq_cost to partial prefixes as if they were admissible A*/MCTS lower bounds or for unsafe pruning (Gen21, Gen25, Gen26; all 0.0) produced invalid schedules or incorrect costs.
- Heavy O(n^2) precomputation without disciplined reuse hurt robustness under budget. When pairwise/singleton tables weren’t tightly integrated with a memoized evaluator and bounded search (e.g., Cluster‑guided MCTS; 0.0), the overhead did not translate to better schedules and contributed to failures.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective:
  - Comprehensive yet disciplined memoization: a single cost_cache for all prefix/extension evaluations minimizes simulator calls and powers both search and VNS.
  - Tournament guidance with localized context: W margins built from M[i][j] steer candidate preselection using only recent prefix items (recent_k=4), balancing global pairwise signals with local context.
  - Bounded, diversified beam with shallow lookahead: adaptive beam width (6–16), capped candidates per expand (6–14), top-k/next-k lookahead, and diverse starts (tournament-best, top-singleton, random distinct) improve exploration without blowing the budget.
  - Layered VNS tuned to scale: cheap tournament bubble and adjacent swaps first, then sampled 2-opt and relocations, followed by a constrained ruin‑and‑recreate (block_size ~ n/6, rr_tries ≤ 2). Each step uses the same evaluator cache, yielding reliable post‑beam gains.
- Concrete coding patterns tied to impact:
  - State deduplication via (tuple(prefix), frozenset(remaining)) keys reduces redundant expansions in the beam, seen in the best program and reflected in the “incumbent pruning” feedback for other high scorers (e.g., Greedy‑VNS Adaptive Lookahead; 3.40).
  - Precompute singleton and pairwise costs once and reuse broadly (best program; 3.41; Tournament‑guided VNS; 3.03). When combined with caching, the O(n^2) work pays off in better candidate ranking and fewer expensive full evaluations later.
  - Robustness in infra matters: correct high scorers either provide stable repo path handling and/or deterministic seeding (Greedy‑VNS Adaptive Lookahead; 3.40; Deterministic Beam + VNS; 2.30), whereas brittle path hacks correlate with 0.0 scores.
  - Shallow lookahead is sufficient when paired with strong heuristics and caching. Both the best program (lookahead_top=3, next_k=5) and Beam‑guided memoized (2.02) show that limited extra peeking significantly improves expansion ranking without heavy overhead.

## Performance Analysis
- The current best (3.41) edges past the prior top greedy+VNS baseline (3.40) by adding tournament-guided pairwise preselection and a beam with shallow lookahead, confirming that combining pairwise tournament signals with bounded beam exploration and VNS yields the strongest results.
- Tournament-guided methods vary with implementation discipline: Tournament‑guided VNS Transaction Scheduler (3.03) is solid but trails the best; its lack of a full beam/lookahead stack likely explains the gap. Earlier tournament-beam attempts with brittle infra or unsafe prefix use failed entirely (Gen21/Gen26; 0.0), underscoring that the guidance is valuable only when integrated correctly.
- Beam-centric designs with deterministic control and caching are consistently competitive but trail the best when capped tightly by time or lacking richer neighborhoods: Deterministic Beam + VNS (2.30) and Beam‑guided memoized (2.02) both pass validations but score lower, reflecting constraints like fixed per‑workload time budgets and shallower lookahead.
- GRASP-style randomized greedy with micro‑beam and VNS (2.43) sits between pure beam and tournament‑guided beam+VNS, suggesting that intensification plus memoization helps, but pairwise tournament guidance and structured beam exploration push scores higher.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Add an incumbent-seeded, two-phase beam with safe pruning and periodic greedy completions
   - Phase A: run a quick, broader beam (beam=16, cand=12, lookahead_top=4/next_k=6) for the first ~40% of depth, and at each depth greedily complete the top 2 prefixes using tournament_bubble_pass + W-ranked insertions to update a global incumbent. Phase B: rerun the beam from depth d with tighter params (beam=10, cand=8, lookahead_top=3/next_k=5) and prune any child whose immediate cost evaluate_seq(seq+[t]) ≥ incumbent; keep a deterministic fallback if all are pruned. This leverages the best program’s lookahead and W guidance while safely reducing search after a strong incumbent is found.

2. Introduce prefix-dominance pruning keyed by (remaining, last-k suffix)
   - Maintain a map best[(frozenset(remaining), tuple(seq[-k:]))] = lowest cost seen; when expanding, skip any state with equal signature and higher cost (k=3–4 works well). This extends the current dedup (prefix+remaining) with a dominance notion that collapses redundant frontiers and retains diversity, mirroring incumbent-style pruning seen in other high scorers.

3. Depth-adaptive lookahead plus buddy-biased second step using precomputed M/W
   - Build for each t a buddy list B[t] of 6–8 txns that minimize M[t][u] (and/or most negative W[t][u]); in lookahead, choose u from B[t] ∩ remaining first. Use depth-adaptive settings: early L=4/next_k=6, mid L=3/5, late L=2/4, and shrink recent_k from 5→3 over depth to balance global and local signals. This preserves the best program’s shallow lookahead but improves its accuracy and speed by focusing on high-synergy pairs.

4. Tournament-guided, block-aware VNS with ΔW gating and boundary-focused ruin-and-recreate
   - For swaps/relocates, compute a cheap surrogate ΔW from W around edited indices and only fully evaluate the top 35–40% moves per phase, plus ~10% random for diversity. For ruin-and-recreate, pick the block around the most violated adjacency (argmax |W[a][b]| where prefer_before fails), internally tournament-bubble the removed block, then try only the top-3 reinsertion positions predicted by local ΔW. Add one block-swap neighborhood (swap two blocks of size 3–6 selected at violated boundaries) before relocates to unlock non-local improvements with limited calls.

5. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared memo and parameter perturbations
   - Run 2–3 short restarts per workload with shared cost_cache/M/W and fixed seeds (e.g., rng = random.Random(1729 + workload.num_txns + r)), then VNS the best two schedules. Vary key knobs per restart: (beam,cand,lookahead_top,next_k,recent_k) ∈ {(16,12,4,6,5), (12,14,3,5,4), (10,10,3,4,3)}. This exploits the best program’s cache-centric design to cheaply broaden exploration while keeping results reproducible and robust.
