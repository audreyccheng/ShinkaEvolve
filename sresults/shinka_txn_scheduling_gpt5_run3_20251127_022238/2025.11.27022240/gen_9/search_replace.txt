<DESCRIPTION>
I introduce a conflict-aware pairwise tournament precomputation and use it to guide both the construction and local improvement phases. Specifically:

- Precompute pairwise costs M[i][j] = cost([i, j]) and preference margins W[i][j] = M[i][j] - M[j][i]. This captures read/write conflict asymmetries cheaply across all transaction pairs.
- Build a tournament order (small score means earlier placement) and a cheap comparator prefer_before(a, b) to quickly resolve local inversions without simulator calls.
- Replace random candidate sampling during greedy construction with tournament-guided preselection: for each step, pick the top-k candidates that are most compatible with the recent placed transactions using W. Apply the same guidance to lookahead, significantly reducing poor expansions.
- Add a deterministic “tournament” seed among restarts, and perform a cheap pairwise bubble pass on the constructed sequence before invoking expensive local search.
- Enhance local improvement with an initial tournament-based pass, preserved adjacent-swap/insertion moves, and add limited non-adjacent swap attempts.

These changes focus the expensive simulator calls on high-potential candidates directly tied to minimizing makespan while still escaping local minima through VNS, improving schedules consistently without a heavy runtime increase. Memoization remains in place to reuse evaluation results.
