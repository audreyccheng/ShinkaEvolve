  "meta_summary": "**Program Name: Greedy sampled transaction scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a greedy cost-sampling scheduler: start at a random transaction, then at each step evaluate up to 10 randomly selected candidates via workload.get_opt_seq_cost and pick the minimum; sample_rate is fixed at 1.0 so only the greedy path runs. Includes robust repo-root path discovery; num_seqs and workload_size are unused, costs are recomputed redundantly, and randomness is unseeded.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 2.65 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); correct and passes all validation tests with execution time recorded.\n- **Feedback**: Greedy sampling trades optimality for speed; unseeded randomness can cause variability\u2014seeding or multi-start runs could stabilize/improve scores. Removing redundant cost recomputations and honoring num_seqs/sample_rate would reduce overhead and enable broader exploration.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam-search transaction scheduler with memoized costs**\n- **Implementation**: Uses beam search with dynamic beam/branch sizing, memoized prefix cost evaluation, and multiple random restarts. Initializes the beam from sampled singletons and prunes to top unique prefixes at each depth to control breadth.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 3.40; produced valid schedules for all three workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Dynamic sizing and memoization reduced search overhead, while random restarts improved robustness; capped beam (\u226432) and branch (\u226424) factors kept runtime reasonable but can miss global optima due to stochastic pruning. Re-evaluating final schedules confirmed consistency of reported makespans.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name beam_search_with_memoized_costs - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam + local search transaction scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a beam search with memoized partial-cost evaluations (Workload.get_opt_seq_cost) and adaptive beam width (from num_seqs) plus sampled candidate expansions, followed by local improvements via adjacent swaps and sampled insertion. Includes robust repository path discovery to import simulator/workloads reliably.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.19 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Memoization and controlled branching reduce simulator calls and help meet the time budget, while local improvements further lower makespan beyond the beam result. Randomized starts and sampling introduce run-to-run variance without a fixed seed.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name beam_search_local_improve - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Multi-start Greedy Scheduler with Lookahead and Local Search**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a multi-start greedy constructor with full candidate evaluation, limited two-step lookahead, and a memoized cost cache. Final schedules are refined via adjacent-swap hill climbing and accept-if-better random insertions, with starts seeded from lowest-cost singletons.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 3.40 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Memoization and lookahead improve selection quality and reduce redundant cost calls, while local search finds additional improvements after greedy construction. Runtime is mitigated by sampling and bounded local moves, though full candidate evaluation per step remains a potential bottleneck on larger instances.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name greedy_full_eval_beam_local - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-ILS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Builds a pairwise preference matrix from O(n^2) length-1/2 simulations to score transactions and locally sort via tournament comparisons, then applies memoized true-cost refinement with one adjacent-swap pass, limited ruin-and-recreate (sampled insert positions), and sampled insertion moves; refinement budget scales with num_seqs. A cached evaluator avoids redundant simulator calls across candidates.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 2.87 on 3 workloads (300 transactions); all validation tests passed.\n- **Feedback**: Pairwise surrogate costs provided strong ordering signals and reduced expensive evaluations, with memoization further decreasing simulator calls. The constrained ILS budget (single true-cost pass and up to two ruin-and-recreate tries) likely caps peak optimality while keeping runtime controlled.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name pairwise_tournament_rank_ils - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: MCTS + VND Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: UCT-based MCTS over partial schedules with progressive widening, greedy-biased expansion, cost caching, and a transposition table; rollouts use limited lookahead with pruning and are followed by VND local search (adjacent swaps, insertions, small block moves). The final schedule is extracted via most-visited children with greedy fallback, and evaluated across three workloads.\n- **Performance**: Combined score: 0.0; did not pass validation.\n- **Feedback**: Failures likely stem from nondeterminism (no fixed RNG seed), heavy iteration budgets causing timeouts, and brittle repo path discovery; partial-cost reliance may also mismatch the simulator API. Seed the RNG, cap/scale iteration budgets, simplify imports to avoid filesystem probing, and verify partial-cost calls against the provided Workload interface.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name uct_mcts_vnd_scheduler - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Hybrid Beam-GRASP Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Alternates a beam search with shallow lookahead and a GRASP constructor, using adaptive beam/branch sizes scaled by N and a shared memoized cost cache under a 0.35s per-workload time budget. A local search phase (adjacent swaps, random swaps, sampled insertions) refines each constructed sequence.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.56 on 3 workloads (300 transactions) within the time budget, and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: The hybrid construction plus local improvement consistently finds low-makespan schedules under tight time constraints, aided by caching and adaptive sampling. Beam truncation with greedy completion can occur when the budget is tight, but outputs remain valid.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name beam_grasp_ils_hybrid - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Multi-start Greedy VNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized partial-sequence evaluator with multi-start greedy construction (limited lookahead) and Variable Neighborhood Search combining adjacent swaps, sampled relocations, and light ruin-and-recreate; seeding is diversified via singleton-cost rankings and budgets adapt to problem size. Includes adaptive candidate sampling and restart strategies to control simulator calls and runtime.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 3.24 across three workloads (300 transactions); produced valid schedules and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Memoization significantly cuts simulator evaluations, enabling stronger local search within the given budget, while adaptive sampling and restrained ruin-and-recreate maintain good makespan-quality/runtime trade-offs. Time-based RNG seeding yields non-deterministic results across runs.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name greedy_lookahead_rr_vns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Marginal-Cost LNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Employs a marginal-cost-guided LNS: a lazy candidate-pool greedy constructor with limited lookahead builds seeds, a global cost cache accelerates evals, adjacent-swap hill-climb cleans up, and hot windows (chosen via prefix marginals) are reordered using budgeted permutation enumeration/sampling; targeted relocate moves, multi-start seeding, and final random insertions provide additional refinement.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.18 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Evaluation indicates robust correctness and effective heuristic improvements from caching and windowed LNS/relocate moves; the score suggests remaining headroom, potentially addressable via adaptive pool/window sizes or dynamic permutation budgets.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name marginal_lns_pool - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Greedy VNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses pairwise-tournament-guided greedy construction with limited lookahead and a global memoized cost cache. Precomputes singleton/pairwise costs to form preference margins, applies multi-start seeding, and refines schedules via VNS (tournament bubble cleanup, adjacent swaps, relocations, non-adjacent swaps, and ruin-and-recreate).\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.12 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Precomputing pairwise preferences and caching partial evaluations effectively cut simulator calls and guided the search toward low-conflict orderings. Multi-start plus VNS consistently improved makespan, and size-aware budgeting maintained stable performance across varying workload complexities.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name pairwise_guided_greedy_vns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Preference-Guided Beam Search Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized cost oracle and a sampled pairwise preference model to compute soft precedence weights, guiding a time-bounded beam search scored by true cost plus penalty with shallow lookahead and adaptive beam/branch sizes. A multi-pass LocalRefiner fixes high-weight violations, then performs adjacent swaps, random insertions, and long swaps, with a SchedulerEngine allocating time across preference building, construction, and refinement per workload size.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.04 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests within the ~0.75s/workload budget.\n- **Feedback**: Preference sampling and cost memoization effectively reduce search overhead, while lookahead and violation-guided refinement yield consistent makespan improvements. Dynamic scaling and ALNS-style moves aid solution quality, though the modest score indicates potential gains from deeper lookahead or broader restart strategies under the same time budget.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name pref_beam_alns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam search scheduler with caching and refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Time-bounded beam search using marginal-cost ordering and shallow lookahead, with shared memoization caches (cost/delta), incumbent-based pruning, greedy completion, and a local improvement pass (adjacent swaps plus random insertions). Beam/branch widths scale with workload size and multiple restarts run within the budget.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.93 across 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Caching and marginal-cost ordering reduce redundant evaluations and focus exploration, while shallow lookahead and greedy completion tighten pruning against the incumbent. The lightweight local refinement yields incremental gains without exceeding the per-workload time budget.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name beam_astar_delta_local - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: A*-beam scheduler with memoized delta costs**\n- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-guided beam search with delta-based candidate ordering, greedy two-step lookahead completion, and local polishing (adjacent swaps and sampled insertions). A shared CostOracle memoizes cost and marginal deltas with FIFO-bounded caches, plus multi-profile restarts and adaptive beam/branching from num_seqs.\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; failed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Time-salted RNG seeds and brittle repository path discovery undermine determinism and portability, likely contributing to test failures. The max-singleton lower bound used as f=max(g,h) is not clearly admissible for the remaining cost, risking incorrect pruning and invalid results; additionally, the \u201cpartial sampling\u201d branches are no-ops, reducing intended speedups.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name astar_beam_lns_scheduler - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: A*-guided Beam + Local Search Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-guided beam search with cached sequence costs and marginal deltas, a singleton-cost lower bound, diversified seeding, candidate sampling, two-step lookahead, periodic greedy completions, and multi-restart local search (adjacent swaps and relocations) with shared caches and deterministic RNG. Includes repo-root probing to import external simulator/workloads and aggregates makespan across three workloads.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program failed validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Likely failure stems from brittle external path discovery/imports and/or oversized beam/branch settings causing timeouts; the singleton-based lower bound may be too weak to prune effectively. Additionally, \u2018workload_size\u2019 is unused and restarts share the same RNG stream, reducing diversity and potential solution quality.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name beam_astar_delta_vns - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: A*-guided beam scheduler with local refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Uses an A*-style marginal-cost beam search with shared cost/delta caches, lightweight lookahead, incumbent pruning, greedy completion, and a bounded local improvement phase (adjacent swaps and limited insertions) under a 0.60s per-workload time budget and deterministic multi-mode restarts. It also includes custom repository path discovery and sys.path injection to import the simulator and workloads.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program is marked incorrect and fails validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Fragile import path discovery and strict time budgeting likely caused failures or fallback to low-quality/random schedules, leading to validation failure. The heuristic (max singleton as lower bound) and non-additive g-cost may misguide the beam/A* scoring, further hurting solution quality under tight time limits.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name astar_marginal_beam - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Memoized Beam Search Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a time-bounded, dynamic-width beam search that ranks candidates by marginal cost with shallow lookahead, periodically greedily completes prefixes to tighten the incumbent, and deduplicates prefixes. Shared memoized cost caches span restarts, and a local improvement pass (adjacent swaps plus random insertions) refines the final sequence.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.48 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests within the per-workload 0.55s budget.\n- **Feedback**: Cache reuse and greedy completion reduce redundant evaluations and enable effective pruning under the tight time cap, improving schedule quality. Dynamic beam sizing and local refinement balance exploration and exploitation, though the strict 0.55s budget can limit the number of effective restarts on larger instances.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name precedence_guided_beam_with_lookahead_and_local_refine - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Time-bounded memoized beam scheduler with local search**\n- **Implementation**: Combines adaptive beam search with memoized marginal-cost evaluation and shallow lookahead under a strict time budget. Prefixes are greedily completed with incumbency pruning, then refined by adjacent swaps and sampled insertions across restarts.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.83 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); schedules are valid and all validation tests pass.\n- **Feedback**: Caching of full sequence costs and prefix-extension pairs reduces simulator calls and enables near real-time search, yielding strong makespan within tight budgets. Randomized candidate sampling and restarts introduce variability but help escape local minima; ext_cost recomputes full costs rather than true deltas, which may cap scalability on larger N.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name beam_marginal_memo - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam A*-guided Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Implements beam search with A*-style lower bounds, marginal-cost ordering, shallow lookahead, and greedy multi-prefix completion; shared memoized cost/extension caches across restarts and precomputed singleton costs reduce evaluation overhead. A post-beam local-improvement phase (adjacent swaps, sliding-window insertions, bounded random insertions) refines schedules, with dynamic beam/branch sizing and a 0.55s/workload time budget.\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.28; produced valid schedules for 3 workloads (300 transactions) within the time budget and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Lower-bound pruning plus memoization cut redundant evaluations and accelerate convergence, while sliding-window refinement improves makespan beyond greedy completion. Time-bounded restarts and incumbent tightening via greedy finishes yield robust results, with minor variability due to randomized sampling.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name a_star_lb_beam_and_window_local - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Beam Search with VNS for Scheduling**\n- **Implementation**: Builds a tournament preference matrix from memoized singleton/pairwise costs and runs a beam search with lookahead, tournament-based candidate preselection, diverse starts, and state deduplication. A VNS post-optimizer applies tournament bubble passes, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocations, and ruin-and-recreate, leveraging caching to limit simulator calls.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.41 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Memoization and tournament-guided pruning effectively balance exploration and evaluation cost, yielding strong schedules with a modest beam width. Local VNS refinements reliably improve beam outputs; tuning beam and candidate parameters may further boost results on conflict-heavy workloads.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name tournament_guided_beam_vns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: A*-Guided Beam Scheduler with Greedy Refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a time-budgeted A*-guided beam search using marginal-cost ordering, singleton lower-bound pruning, shallow lookahead, and shared memoized cost caches across restarts with dynamic beam/branch sizing. Beam prefixes are greedily completed to tighten the incumbent and then locally refined via adjacent swaps, insertions, and sparse long swaps.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.07 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Shared caches and LB pruning reduce cost evaluations and help maintain quality under the 0.55s/workload budget; dynamic beam/branching and periodic greedy completion quickly establish strong incumbents. Local refinement yields modest extra gains, but results remain somewhat sensitive to randomness and tight time limits.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name a_star_lb_prune_and_multi_finish - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: MCTS+LNS Conflict-Aware Txn Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Combines MCTS with epsilon-greedy, conflict-biased rollouts and a ruin-and-recreate LNS refinement under a strict time budget. Employs memoized cost caches (full, extension, pairwise, singleton) and sampled conflict weights to guide expansion, rollout, removal, reinsertion, and light swap polishing.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.0 and failed validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Repo path discovery via find_repo_root (using __file__ and hardcoded fallbacks) is brittle and likely caused import/runtime failures; nondeterminism (no seeding) and tight time budgets can yield inconsistent or weak schedules, triggering fallbacks. Stabilize imports, add deterministic seeding, and reassess time allocation to improve robustness and pass validations.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name mcts_lns_hybrid - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided beam search with VNS refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a memoized partial evaluator with precomputed singleton/pairwise costs to build preference margins, then runs a multi-restart beam search with incumbent pruning, buddy-list lookahead, and tournament-based candidate preselection. A local improvement phase applies violation-focused adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocate moves, and ruin-and-recreate; RNG is seeded for determinism and repository path resolution is handled via a custom finder.\n- **Performance**: Combined score: 0.0; the program failed validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Failures likely stem from brittle repo path detection or reliance on partial-sequence evaluation (get_opt_seq_cost) that may not match the expected API, leading to incorrect results. Aggressive pruning and heavy O(n^2) precomputation may also hurt robustness/performance on some workloads.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name beam_multirestart_incumbent_buddies - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Lookahead Greedy TXN Scheduler with Local Search**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a time-bounded, memoized greedy constructor with restricted candidate lists and two-step lookahead, multi-start seeding from best singletons plus random seeds, and a local search phase (adjacent swaps and random insertions). Uses caching of sequence and extension costs and attempts auto-discovery of import paths.\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; failed validation.\n- **Feedback**: Likely failures stem from unseeded randomness and time-based control causing nondeterministic outputs, and brittle path-hacking for imports that may break in the evaluator. Fix imports, seed the RNG, and replace time-based limits with deterministic iteration bounds to satisfy validation.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name memoized_lookahead_greedy_ils - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Greedy-VNS Transaction Scheduler with Adaptive Lookahead**\n- **Implementation**: Multi-start greedy construction (10 restarts) with deterministic per-workload RNG, memoized sequence-costs, incumbent pruning, and adaptive lookahead over top candidates; followed by VNS-style local improvement (adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, insertion, targeted high-marginal relocations, and light ruin-and-recreate with greedy reinsertion). Robust repo-root discovery and seeding ensure reproducibility and stable imports.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.40 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Incumbent pruning and caching reduce redundant evaluations, while adaptive lookahead and targeted relocations improve makespan quality; deterministic seeding yields consistent, repeatable outcomes. The balance of randomized restarts with focused local refinements provides strong correctness with dependable performance.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam-guided memoized transaction scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses beam search with adaptive beam/branching, one-step lookahead, and early incumbent tightening, supported by memoized prefix/extension costs. Completes prefixes via greedy marginal-cost selection, then applies local refinement (adjacent swaps and random insertions) with multiple restarts under a per-workload time budget (0.65s).\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.02 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests within the set time budget.\n- **Feedback**: Caching and marginal-cost lookahead improved pruning and reduced expensive evaluations; restarts enhanced exploration. The shallow lookahead and fixed time cap likely cap peak quality for larger N but delivered consistent, timely solutions here.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name beam_memo_local_refine - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Cluster-guided MCTS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses MCTS with UCT, memoized cost calls, pairwise cost matrix (M), W-margins, tournament ordering, conflict clustering (|W| 70th percentile), buddy lists, W/cluster-guided rollouts, incumbent pruning via prefix \u201clower bounds,\u201d multi-restarts, and a final adjacent-swap polish. Path bootstrapping attempts to locate the example repo dynamically before importing workloads/simulator.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails validation tests and yields incorrect results.\n- **Feedback**: Reliance on get_opt_seq_cost for partial prefixes (used for lb, M, W) likely violates simulator assumptions, making pruning unsafe and schedules invalid. Heavy O(n^2) precomputation of M/W contradicts the intended \u201cfew simulator calls\u201d design and may hurt runtime; ensure valid lower bounds or restrict to full-sequence evaluations and harden path discovery to pass tests.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name mcts_clustered_ucb - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Tournament beam search with VNS refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Builds singleton/pairwise cost matrices to derive a tournament preference order, then runs a deterministic multi-restart beam search with memoized evaluations, incumbent pruning, buddy-guided lookahead, and periodic greedy completions; the best sequence is refined by a VNS applying tournament cleanups, swaps, relocations, and ruin-and-recreate. It uses a global cost cache, diverse seeded starts, and custom repo-path discovery to load workloads.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program fails all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: The algorithm evaluates partial prefixes with get_opt_seq_cost (e.g., [i], [i, j]), which may violate the simulator\u2019s contract and lead to invalid costs/schedules; ensure pruning/metrics use APIs that support prefixes or evaluate only full permutations. The custom path probing is brittle in test environments\u2014stabilize imports and add schedule validity checks before reporting results.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: GRASP Micro-Beam Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Hybrid GRASP with randomized greedy RCL and micro-beam intensification, time-bounded multi-starts, and memoized cost/extension caches for true marginal-cost evaluation. Seeds from top singletons/pairs with adaptive candidate pools and RCL by depth, followed by local refinement (adjacent swaps, 2-opt, insertions) and permutation repair.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 2.43 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Caching and adaptive sampling cut evaluations and stabilized quality under a tight ~0.36s+N-scaled budget; micro-beam and local search consistently improved greedy builds. Additional time could be leveraged by deeper beams or richer neighborhoods for further gains.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name grasp_beam_hybrid_v1 - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided VNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Builds schedules via tournament-guided greedy with buddy-list lookahead over memoized simulator costs, using precomputed singleton/pairwise matrices and preference margins. Refines solutions with a VNS combining tournament cleanup, adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, targeted relocations, and light ruin\u2011and\u2011recreate across multi-start seeds with deterministic RNG.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.03 on three workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Pairwise-preference seeding plus memoized evaluations effectively reduce simulator calls and focus search, while VNS post-optimization further lowers makespan. Deterministic runs and diversified restarts produce stable, high-quality schedules under modest exploration budgets.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name tournament_guided_buddy_lookahead - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Deterministic Beam Search with VNS for Txn Scheduling**\n- **Implementation**: Uses sampled pairwise preference margins to build conflict clusters and buddy lists, then runs a deterministic multi-restart beam search with shared memoization and greedy completions, followed by VNS local refinement guided by a surrogate boundary-margin score. Caches sequence and extension costs, caps pairwise probes, and allocates a fixed per-workload time budget to bound runtime.\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.30 on 3 workloads (300 transactions); program is correct and passes all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Deterministic seeding and caching stabilized quality and reduced evaluations under tight time budgets; clustering and buddy-biased candidate pools effectively narrowed the search to yield good schedules quickly. Note: the num_seqs parameter is unused, and the probe cap/weak LB may trade optimality for speed on larger instances.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name clustered_beam_vns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam-A* Transaction Scheduler with Greedy Refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Uses beam search with memoized prefix/extension costs, singleton-based A* lower bounds, shallow lookahead ranking, and greedy completion to tighten incumbents, followed by a lightweight local improvement (adjacent swaps and random insertions). Parameters adapt to problem size (beam/branch factors), unique-prefix deduplication is enforced, and a 0.40s time budget with 1\u20133 restarts bounds runtime.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 2.49 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); produces valid schedules and passes all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Effective caching and pruning reduce evaluations, while greedy finishing frequently improves incumbents under the tight budget. The strict time cap and shallow local search can cap optimality, and unseeded randomness may introduce run-to-run variance.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name beam_greedy_prune_local - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament beam search with VNS refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a tournament-guided, incumbent-pruned beam search with lookahead, backed by memoized cost evaluation and precomputed singleton/pairwise costs to derive preference margins. Refines candidates via a robust VNS local search (bubble-based tournament cleanup, adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, relocations, targeted marginal relocations, and a light ruin-and-recreate), integrated with a Workload simulator after repo-path discovery.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.75 over 3 workloads (261 transactions), producing schedules for each workload.\n- **Feedback**: The program is incorrect and fails validation tests; likely risk points include reliance on partial-sequence cost evaluations during search and the possibility of returning/pruning to incomplete or invalid permutations. Add strict permutation completion/validation and align evaluator semantics for partial sequences to improve correctness.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name tournament_beam_vns_pruned - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-guided beam search with VNS for txn scheduling**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a two-phase, time-bounded buddy-guided beam search with prefix-dominance and incumbent/singleton-LB pruning, shallow lookahead, memoized cost evaluations, and greedy completion, followed by lightweight VNS (adjacent swaps and relocations) with deterministic portfolio restarts. Buddy lists are built from singleton-delta scoring to focus branching; safety checks repair permutations if needed.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 2.09 across 3 workloads (300 transactions); all validations passed.\n- **Feedback**: Buddy guidance and caching concentrate the search and cut evaluations, while greedy finishing and VNS provide incremental gains under the tight ~0.58s/workload budget. Deterministic seeding stabilizes results; note that some parameters (e.g., next_k) are unused and deeper exploration may be constrained by the time cap.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name buddy_beam_vns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided Greedy + LNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Precomputes singleton/pairwise costs and tournament margins to drive a greedy constructor with buddy lookahead and a refreshable candidate pool, backed by a global cost cache. Improves via multi-start, adjacent swaps, boundary-focused LNS with capped permutations/relocate moves, then 2-opt and random insertions, with incumbent pruning.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.34 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Pairwise tournament guidance and buddy-based lookahead produce strong seeds that LNS refines effectively; caching significantly amortizes evaluation cost. Runtime is driven by cost evaluations and permutation sampling, but pool preselection, small windows (k\u22647), and early termination keep it tractable.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name tournament_buddies_lns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-Guided Beam Search with VNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Two-phase beam search driven by buddy lists, prefix-dominance pruning (local/global), shallow adaptive lookahead, and incumbent-based pruning, all under a 0.58s time budget. Uses cached cost/extension evaluations, greedy completions, and a lightweight VNS refinement (adjacent swaps, boundary repair via surrogate pair costs, and targeted relocations) with portfolio-based restarts.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.57 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules under a 0.58s per-workload time budget.\n- **Feedback**: Buddy-guided candidate pools and caching reduced evaluation overhead while improving search focus; prefix-dominance and incumbent pruning effectively cut the search space, and VNS yielded incremental post-optimization gains. Performance is sensitive to beam/branch settings and time budget, but the approach is robust and passes all validation tests.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name buddy_beam_prefix_dominance_vns_plus - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided LNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a tournament-guided greedy constructor with buddy lookahead, backed by a global cost cache, precomputed singleton/pairwise costs (M) and preference margins (W). Multi-start seeding combines a beam search with dominance pruning (by remaining set and suffix) and greedy completion, followed by adjacent swaps, boundary-focused LNS over hot windows (marginal sums and violation boundaries), targeted relocations, 2-opt, and random insert polish; includes early pruning against the incumbent.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.47 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Tournament/buddy guidance and caching significantly reduced evaluation overhead and improved early choices, while LNS on high-impact windows delivered most of the final gains. Beam-seed quality and the num_seqs exploration budget were key levers for the makespan\u2013time trade-off, with dominance checks aiding scalability.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided beam search with VNS refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Two-phase beam search seeded by tournament scores with precomputed singleton/pairwise costs to derive preference margins (W) and buddy lists, plus prefix-dominance pruning, adaptive lookahead, periodic greedy completions, and a VNS post-optimizer (bubble pass, adjacent swaps, sampled 2-opt, relocations, ruin-and-recreate).

Uses a memoized evaluator, a pairwise cost matrix with preference margins, and deterministic RNG; includes path discovery to import simulator/workloads.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails validation tests, yielding no valid metric.\n- **Feedback**: A critical bug in the greedy seed cleanup assigns a function to seq0 instead of a list (uses a \u201cno-op tuple trick\u201d), causing type errors and invalid execution; replace with seq0 = tournament_bubble_pass(seq0, passes=2). The O(n^2) precomputation and frequent evaluate_seq calls are costly; caching helps but runtime risk remains high.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name hybrid_beam_lns_buddy - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: MCTS + LNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: UCT-style MCTS with progressive widening, conflict-aware greedy rollouts guided by singleton costs and pairwise-preference \u201cbuddies,\u201d plus an elite Order Crossover; followed by a focused LNS (adjacent swaps, relocations, small block reinserts) under a tight time budget.

The disabled mid-run greedy probe and constrained branching keep runtime stable but may limit peak optimality on larger instances.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name dom_beam_pruned_v2 - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Incumbent-aware beam and LNS transaction scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Combines beam search with incumbent-aware greedy completion, global prefix-dominance caching, anti-buddy filtering from pairwise preferences, and depth-adaptive lookahead; shared cost/extension caches and deterministic seeding ensure fast, reproducible scoring. A \u0394W-gated LNS phase (block swap/reinsert and adjacent swaps) refines top seeds under an evaluation cap.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 1.85 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules within the ~0.5\u20130.58s per-instance budget and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Pairwise sampling and anti-buddy gating effectively reduce branching without degrading quality, while LNS reliably improves the beam\u2019s best candidates. Sensitivity may remain to W/D sampling coverage and percentile thresholds, but shared dominance and caching choices balance speed and quality well.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name beam_lns_prefixdom_v3 - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-Guided Beam Search with VNS Refinement**\n- **Implementation**: Two-phase, time-bounded beam search guided by learned buddy/anti-buddy heuristics, global/local prefix-dominance pruning with adaptive k-suffix, shallow lookahead, and incumbent-based pruning, with memoized cost/extension caches. Solutions are greedily completed and locally improved via a lightweight VNS (adjacent swaps, ruin-recreate, block swaps, relocations).\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.82 on three workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Buddy-guided candidate pools and anti-buddy gating effectively reduce branching without degrading quality, while prefix-dominance and LB pruning stabilize runtime. The beam-parameter portfolio plus VNS consistently tightens the incumbent within the ~0.58s/workload budget, contributing materially to the final score.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name prefix_dom_antibuddy_lns - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam+LNS Makespan Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Time-bounded portfolio of beam search plus conflict-aware greedy completion, using depth-adaptive lookahead, global prefix-dominance pruning, and buddy/anti-buddy heuristics derived from sampled pairwise preferences with cached cost evaluations. Post-optimization uses LNS (adjacent swaps, block swap, and block reinsert) guided by a \u0394W surrogate to refine top candidates; deterministic RNG ensures reproducibility.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.16 across 3 workloads (300 transactions total), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests within an ~0.50\u20130.58s per-workload budget.\n- **Feedback**: Prefix-dominance, caching, and anti-buddy filtering effectively reduce redundant evaluations and steer the beam toward promising prefixes, while LNS provides consistent incremental gains on the best candidates. The sampled preference matrix and depth-adaptive parameters balance exploration and speed, though limited pairwise probing and time budgets may cap deeper search on larger N.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name greedy_lookahead_prefixdom - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Portfolio beam-greedy scheduler with LNS**\n- **Implementation**: Combines beam search and tournament-guided greedy builders using precomputed pairwise cost matrix (M), preference margins (W), buddy/anti-buddy heuristics, prefix-dominance pruning, and incumbent-aware greedy completions. A \u0394W-gated large-neighborhood search performs window permutations, block swaps/reinserts, adjacency-based surrogate ranking, and final 2-opt/insertion polishing under evaluation caps with deterministic RNG.\n- **Performance**: Combined score reported as 0.0; the program fails validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Despite a rich heuristic portfolio and pruning, the solution appears brittle in validation (likely due to path/import assumptions or unmet API/edge-case handling), yielding no credit. Stabilizing environment discovery, tightening correctness checks, and adding guardrails for fallback behavior would improve reliability and test pass rates.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 75 - Patch Name incumbent_portfolio_beam_lns - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Beam-Greedy \u0394W-LNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Time-bounded (~0.58s) beam search with greedy completion uses cached singleton/extension costs, a sampled pairwise preference matrix (W), anti-buddy thresholds (75th percentile), and unified prefix-dominance pruning with depth-adaptive lookahead and incumbent-aware probes. A \u0394W-gated LNS performs block swaps/reinserts plus adjacent passes, with deterministic portfolio restarts and final permutation repair for safety.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.31 on 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Anti-buddy filtering and prefix-dominance pruning effectively reduced unpromising branches while preserving high-quality extensions; \u0394W-guided LNS delivered final refinements after beam+greedy established strong prefixes. Deterministic portfolio restarts improved robustness without breaching the time budget.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 76 - Patch Name beam_lns_prefixdom_v3 - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-guided beam search scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a hybrid buddy-guided beam search with memoized extension costs, singleton-based lower bounds, and prefix-dominance pruning; candidate pools leverage buddy lists with anti-buddy thresholds, shallow lookahead, and greedy completions. Multiple restarts plus a lightweight local search (adjacent swaps and relocations) refine results within a tight time budget.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.34 across three workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Caching and pruning reduce evaluations and keep runtime predictable, while restarts and local tweaks effectively tighten the incumbent. Anti-buddy gating and lookahead focus expansions, though solution quality is ultimately bounded by the fixed time budget.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 78 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-guided Beam+GRASP-ILS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Time-bounded, cache-accelerated beam search with global/local prefix-dominance, buddy/anti-buddy heuristics, shallow lookahead, and greedy completion.

Local improvement consistently tightened incumbents, and GRASP/portfolio diversification prevented premature convergence.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 79 - Patch Name antibuddy_gating_and_filters - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-guided beam search transaction scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Implements a hybrid buddy-guided beam search with memoized extension costs, greedy incumbent tightening, and lightweight local improvement (adjacent swaps + relocations). Builds buddy lists from pairwise cost deltas, uses singleton-cost lower bounds and a prefix-dominance map to prune, and completes prefixes via greedy lookahead under a tight time budget with multi-restarts.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.29 on 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests within the set time budgets.\n- **Feedback**: Cost caching and guided candidate pools significantly reduce evaluations and focus the beam, delivering good solutions quickly. The weak singleton lower bound and compact local search keep runtime low but may limit deeper exploration; modestly increasing beam/branch factors or time could further reduce makespan.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 80 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-guided LNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Heuristic scheduler combining tournament-based pairwise-preference ordering with buddy lookahead, beam-seeded greedy construction, and boundary-focused Large Neighborhood Search, plus 2-opt and random insertion polishing. It precomputes a pairwise cost matrix, uses anti-buddy gating, prefix-dominance pruning keyed by remaining-set and suffix, and a global cost cache.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program fails validation/tests.\n- **Feedback**: A missing function call (tournament_bubble_pass) in lns_improve triggers a runtime error; the repository path autodiscovery may also be brittle. Define/remove the missing routine and consider cutting redundant eval_seq calls or making seeding deterministic to improve robustness and runtime.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name incumbent_aware_beam_prefix_dom_antibuddy_lns_bubble - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Beam-guided VNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Multi-start beam search with incumbent pruning uses tournament-derived pairwise costs (M/W), buddy lists, anti-buddy gating, and prefix-dominance memoization (remaining-set + suffix) to build schedules, then applies VNS-style local search (swaps, relocations, ruin-and-recreate, window/block ops) to refine them. Deterministic RNG and a sequence-cost memo cache reduce variance and redundant evaluations.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails validation tests and produces incorrect results.\n- **Feedback**: Reliance on get_opt_seq_cost for partial sequences and aggressive prefix-dominance pruning likely breaks API assumptions or yields invalid schedules; path probing for external modules further risks runtime failures. Ensure full-permutation validity, add robust fallbacks/imports, and reduce brittle pruning to improve correctness and scoring.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 81 - Patch Name beam_greedy_antibuddy_fix_and_bubble_cleanup - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Beam+Greedy LNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Precomputes singleton/pairwise costs to build a tournament matrix, then runs beam-seeded and adaptive greedy constructors with shared prefix-dominance pruning, followed by LNS (bubble, anchored permutations, block swaps/reinserts) and small 2-opt/insert finishes. Uses memoized cost caching, buddy/anti-buddy guidance, a global incumbent across portfolio restarts, and custom repo path discovery.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; the program is marked incorrect and fails validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Determinism is undermined by seeding RNGs with Python's randomized hash, the search-budget parameter (num_seqs) is ignored, and brittle filesystem path injection can fail in the evaluator. Extensive O(n^2) precomputation and frequent seq_cost calls may cause timeouts; honoring num_seqs and removing path hacks would likely improve robustness.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 82 - Patch Name fusion_beam_portfolio_v3 - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Conflict-aware MCTS-LNS Transaction Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: UCT-style MCTS with progressive widening and a transposition table, using conflict-aware greedy rollouts guided by sampled pairwise margins (anti-buddy gating), singleton heuristics, and cached cost/extension evaluations; elite order-crossover injects diversity. A focused LNS phase (adjacent swaps, relocations, small block reinserts, limited 2-opt) refines the incumbent under a tight per-workload time budget (~0.58\u20130.66s).\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.79 across three workloads (300 transactions) with valid schedules; all validation tests passed.\n- **Feedback**: Pairwise-informed candidate ranking and anti-buddy filtering reduced poor extensions and improved rollout quality, while caching kept evaluations efficient within the time cap. The fixed short budget limits exploration depth, but elite crossover plus LNS consistently recovered additional improvements after MCTS.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 83 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Beam-seeded VNS with prefix pruning**\n- **Implementation**: Two-phase beam-seeded constructive search uses tournament/buddy heuristics, memoized cost evaluation, prefix-dominance pruning with suffix signatures, adaptive lookahead, and anti-buddy filters. A deterministic multi-restart phase is followed by a VNS-style local improvement suite (adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, targeted relocations, ruin-and-recreate, window permutations, and block swaps/reinserts).\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 3.47 across 3 workloads (300 transactions), producing valid schedules and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Incumbent tightening via periodic greedy completions and shared prefix-dominance significantly pruned the search and improved makespan stability; tournament/W-guided candidate selection reduced harmful adjacencies. The main tradeoff is heavier upfront pairwise cost computation and frequent scoring, though memoization mitigates recomputation.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 84 - Patch Name fix_beam_prune_and_antibuddy_greedy - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Portfolio Beam+Greedy LNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Combines beam-seeded greedy construction with strengthened local neighborhood search (LNS), sharing a memoized evaluator across stages. Precomputes pairwise cost matrix M and asymmetry W for tournament ranking, uses unified prefix-dominance keyed by (remaining-set, suffix), buddy/anti-buddy gating, and deterministic seeding.\n- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; program failed validation.\n- **Feedback**: Failures likely stem from brittle repository-root import discovery (RuntimeError when openevolve_examples is not found) and potentially heavy search exceeding time limits. Make imports robust to packaging (avoid absolute-path fallbacks), add graceful fallbacks when workloads are missing, and consider tightening search budgets for validation.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 85 - Patch Name portfolio_beam_greedy_lns - Correct Program: False\n\n**Program Name: Conflict-aware beam search scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Uses a beam search with shared prefix-dominance, singleton-based lower bounds, and cached cost/extension evaluations, guided by buddy lists and shallow lookahead.

The adjacent-swap pass provides quick local gains, and portfolio restarts add robustness without significant overhead.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 86 - Patch Name beam_prefix_dom_greedy_ox - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Tournament-Guided Beam+Greedy LNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Builds a pairwise cost matrix and tournament margins to steer a two-phase beam search seeded with good singletons, using greedy completion, buddy-based lookahead, shared prefix-dominance pruning, and multi-start LNS (window permutations, relocate/block moves) with adjacent, 2-opt, and insertion cleanups. Sequence-cost caching is used throughout to minimize repeated evaluations.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 3.68 on 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passed all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Tournament preselection, buddy lookahead, and prefix-dominance effectively prune the search while LNS refines high-impact regions, yielding robust makespans across mixed workloads.

Aggressive cost memoization (prefix and extension caches), anti-buddy thresholds, greedy probes, and portfolio-based restarts diversify and tighten the search.\n- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.58, producing valid schedules for 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Caching plus anti-buddy gating reduced expensive evaluations and pruned weak branches early, while greedy probes and VNS rapidly improved incumbents within the 0.58s budget.

A VNS-style local improvement suite (bubble, adjacent/non-adjacent swaps, insertions, marginal-guided relocates, ruin-and-recreate, window/block permutations and swaps) refines schedules.\n- **Performance**: Combined score 3.37 across three workloads (300 transactions).\n- **Feedback**: Evaluation confirms correctness and reproducibility (passes all validation tests). Prefix-dominance caching and incumbent-driven pruning efficiently cut the search while maintaining solution quality, and the diverse local moves improved final makespan.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 89 - Patch Name bridge_and_bubble_refinements - Correct Program: True\n\n**Program Name: Buddy-Guided Beam + VNS Scheduler**\n- **Implementation**: Two-phase beam search seeded by singleton/pair costs with local/global prefix-dominance pruning, depth-adaptive shallow lookahead, anti-buddy gating, incumbent/LB pruning, and cached cost evaluations; followed by lightweight VNS-style local improvement (adjacent swaps, boundary/block repairs, relocations). A tight time budget (~0.58s/workload) and greedy probes tighten the incumbent to strengthen pruning.\n- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 2.70, producing valid schedules for 3 workloads (300 transactions) and passing all validation tests.\n- **Feedback**: Caching, dominance pruning, and early greedy probes effectively reduce evaluations and focus the search, yielding good makespan under the time budget, while VNS refinement recovers additional improvements from the beam output.

Local refinement neighborhoods consistently delivered incremental gains after constructive phases; portfolio restarts added robustness without sacrificing determinism.\n**Program Identifier:** Generation 99 - Patch Name beam_grasp_lns_prefixdom_v4 - Correct Program: True",
  "meta_scratch_pad": "## Successful Algorithmic Patterns\n- Boundary-focused LNS layered on a guided beam constructor yields the top scores\n  - Current best (Tournament-guided Beam+Greedy LNS Scheduler, 3.68) combines a two-phase beam with greedy completion and a boundary/\u201chot-window\u201d LNS that permutes k\u22646 exhaustively and k=7 by sampling (\u22642000), plus targeted relocate/block-swap/reinsert moves and cheap bubble/2-opt/insert cleanups. Similar but lighter variants (Beam-seeded greedy scheduler with VNS local search, Gen93, 3.37; Beam-guided Greedy VNS Transaction Scheduler, Gen89, 3.37) trail without the stronger boundary-targeted permutations.\n- Incumbent-aware beam with shared dominance and greedy probes tightens bounds early\n  - Gen91 (Buddy-Guided Beam + VNS, 2.70), Gen92 (Buddy-guided Beam + VNS, 2.47), Gen94 (Buddy-Guided Beam+GRASP, 3.16), and Gen99 (Buddy-guided Beam/GRASP ILS, 3.04) all credit incumbent/LB pruning plus periodic greedy completions with reducing expansions and improving makespan under ~0.5\u20130.58s budgets.\n- Tournament/buddy-guided candidate pools with shallow lookahead consistently help\n  - The best program precomputes c1/M/W, builds buddy lists, uses tournament-guided preselection and lookahead, and applies a tournament_bubble_pass polish; these elements also appear in the 3.37 scorers (Gen89, Gen93) and correlate with higher-quality expansions.\n- Unified memoized evaluation across phases is critical\n  - All top performers cache seq_cost across construction/beam/LNS (e.g., Gen87\u2019s 3.68; Gen93\u2019s 3.37), cutting simulator calls and enabling more aggressive pruning/lookahead without breaching time limits.\n\n## Ineffective Approaches\n- Fragile repository path/import handling causes total failure regardless of heuristic quality\n  - Gen96 (Beam+LNS Transaction Scheduler, 0.0) and Gen98 ([Portfolio beam + greedy-LNS], 0.0) fail validation due to brittle repo-root probing and external imports; evaluation notes this overshadowed algorithmic strength and likely breached interface/budget expectations.\n- Overly light local search caps performance\n  - \u201cLightweight\u201d VNS/LNS passes (adjacent-only or limited neighborhoods) in beam variants (Gen91 at 2.70, Gen92 at 2.47, Gen95 at 2.60) underperform compared to boundary-focused LNS with hot-window permutations and targeted non-local moves (current best at 3.68; Gen93 at 3.37).\n- Over-aggressive/invalid pruning or API misuse undermines correctness (from prior insights)\n  - Earlier failures (e.g., Gen81, 0.0) tied to using get_opt_seq_cost for partials combined with aggressive dominance pruning, leading to invalid schedules; contrasts with correct, validation-passing implementations here that keep dominance keyed to (remaining set, short suffix) and respect API constraints.\n\n## Implementation Insights\n- What makes the current best (3.68) effective\n  - Integrated guidance: Precomputed c1/M/W enable tournament ordering, buddy lists, and a tournament_bubble_pass cleanup that cheaply fixes local adjacencies before/after heavier moves.\n  - Beam + greedy promotion + dominance: Two-phase beam with depth-adaptive candidate pools and lookahead, local prefix-dominance (suffix\u22643) inside beam, global dominance shared across greedy restarts, and periodic greedy completions to tighten the incumbent early.\n  - Focused LNS where it matters: Hot windows selected by marginal sums and worst violated adjacencies; exhaustive permutations for k\u22646 and sampled for k=7, plus targeted relocates, block swaps, and block reinsertions; capped budgets keep runtime in check while unlocking non-local improvements.\n  - Unified caching and cheap polish: A single cost_cache shared across phases reduces recomputation; follow-up two-opt and random insertion passes provide deterministic last-mile gains.\n- Additional effective coding patterns from other strong programs\n  - Anti-buddy gating with depth-adaptive thresholds (Gen91 at 2.70; Gen92 at 2.47) avoids harmful adjacencies during construction and improves diversity, though it trails the boundary-LNS approach in peak scores.\n  - Deterministic seeding and portfolio restarts (Gen93 at 3.37; Gen95 at 2.60; Gen99 at 3.04) stabilize outcomes; sharing caches across restarts improves reuse and reduces evaluation cost.\n\n## Performance Analysis\n- Clear advantage for boundary-aware LNS on top of guided beam construction\n  - Current best at 3.68 outperforms similar beam+VNS designs (Gen89 and Gen93 at 3.37; Gen99 at 3.04) and beam+LNS without strong boundary targeting (Gen95 at 2.60), indicating that hot-window permutations and adjacency-informed neighborhoods are decisive.\n- Beam-centric with lightweight local search underperforms\n  - Buddy/anti-buddy guided beams with lightweight VNS/GRASP (Gen91: 2.70; Gen92: 2.47; Gen94: 3.16) improve over naive approaches but fall short of the 3.37\u20133.68 band achieved by stronger LNS.\n- MCTS-LNS is competitive but trails the best beam+boundary-LNS\n  - MCTS-LNS (Gen97, 2.92) benefits from pairwise-guided rollouts and caching, but most gains come from the LNS phase; it converges fast to good regions yet lags boundary-focused LNS in final makespan.\n- Robustness correlates with scoring potential\n  - All high scorers pass validation and emphasize caching, tournament/buddy guidance, and dominance/pruning; 0.0 scorers (Gen96, Gen98) failed due to environment/import brittleness and budget/contract issues, not inherently weaker heuristics.",

Share prefix-dominance across beam and greedy and add child-level greedy promotion\n   - Replace beam\u2019s local dom with the global prefix_dom keyed by (frozenset(remaining), suffix), using suffix_k=3 until 70% depth and suffix_k=4 after. For each expanded parent, run greedy_complete on the top K children by lookahead (K=2 for early/mid depth, K=1 late); prune a child if its greedy-completion cost \u2265 incumbent and update incumbent on improvement. Keep the existing \u201ccomplete top beam items\u201d step; this tightens bounds earlier and reduces expansions, mirroring what worked in top scorers.\n\n2. Upgrade boundary-focused LNS with anchored windows, \u0394W gating, bridge move, and a strict eval cap\n   - When choosing hot windows, add anchored windows around worst-violated adjacencies: fix a or b and permute the k\u22121 interior; keep current marginal-sum windows. Before eval_seq, compute a \u0394W surrogate for candidates (permutations/relocates/block-swaps/reinserts) and evaluate only the top 35\u201340% by \u0394W plus 10% random; enforce a per-round eval_seq cap of 700 with early exit. Raise k=7 sampling to up to 3000 only if the cap hasn\u2019t been hit, add a \u201cbridge\u201d move that extracts a block around b (size 3\u20135), optionally reverses it, and reinserts before a, and run tournament_bubble_pass immediately after any accepted move.\n\n3. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both beam and greedy\n   - Set recent_k by stage: early/mid/late = 5/4/3, and (lookahead_top, next_k) = (4,6), (3,5), (2,4) respectively. Add an anti-buddy guard: if the last placed x has W[x][t] in the top 25% of its row, skip t unless its metric is within 1% of the best at that step; for the single best immediate child, probe one extra depth by minimizing over next_k=4 buddies at depth+2. Apply this uniformly in beam expansion and the greedy builder to concentrate on high-yield continuations while avoiding known-bad adjacencies.\n\n4. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 deterministic restarts with rng = Random(1729 + r) and reuse cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across restarts. Vary beam parameters per restart, e.g., (beam_width, cand_per_expand, lookahead_top, next_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6), (12,14,3,5), (10,10,2,4)}, and apply full lns_improve only to the best two seeds by greedy_complete; keep tournament_bubble_pass and adjacent_pass on all seeds. Add a simple per-restart early-stop: if no improvement after 2 LNS iterations, skip remaining LNS for that restart to keep within budget.\n\n5. Replace late random two-opt/insertion with conflict-targeted 2.5-opt sampling\n   - Build a candidate set from the top-\u03ba worst violated adjacencies (\u03ba = min(20, n//8)); for each (a,b) at positions i,i+1, sample j far from i and evaluate either swapping non-adjacent endpoints (2-opt) or extracting a short block around b (size 3\u20134) and reinserting before a (2.5-opt). Rank candidates by \u0394W = (W[a][b] + W[seq[j]][seq[j+1]]), evaluate only the top 40% plus 10% random under a small budget (50\u201380 trials), and accept the first improving move. This targets the heaviest conflicts more efficiently than uniform two-opt/insertion and aligns with the boundary-aware gains seen in the best program.",
  "meta_recommendations_history": [
    "1. Add a shared cross-restart memoized cache (plus marginal \u0394-cache) for prefix costs\n   - Move cost_cache outside run_beam_search and reuse it across all restarts for the same workload; optionally bound it with an LRU of, e.g., 200k entries. Also cache marginal deltas \u0394(seq, cand) = cost(seq+[cand]) - cost(seq) keyed by (tuple(seq), cand) to avoid recomputing differences repeatedly during expansion. Evidence: global/shared caches consistently lifted performance in other top programs and will let you push wider beams/branches with the same budget.\n\n2. Order and limit branching by marginal cost with a light two-step lookahead\n   - Within each expansion, compute \u0394 for all candidates and sort by \u0394; only expand the top_k = min(branch_factor, 12) cheapest deltas. For the final cut line, use a cheap two-step lookahead for the best few candidates (e.g., try best next-next transaction greedily using cached \u0394) to refine ranking without many simulator calls. Evidence: marginal-cost guidance and bounded local lookahead improved constructive quality in high scorers, and your cache makes \u0394 nearly free.\n\n3. Introduce A*-style scoring and pruning with incumbent-based cuts and a cheap lower bound\n   - Maintain the best full cost found so far (incumbent) and prune any prefix where cost(prefix) \u2265 incumbent. Score beam entries by f = g(prefix) + h(remaining), where h is a fast lower bound such as h = max(singleton_cost[i] for i in remaining), with singleton_cost[i] = get_opt_seq_cost([i]) precomputed and cached; use f for beam ranking and as a secondary tie-breaker even if h is imperfect. Periodically greedily complete the current best beam prefix to refresh a strong incumbent early, tightening pruning. Evidence: structured search with better pruning enabled wider effective exploration and faster convergence in top programs.\n\n4. Add a bounded, cache-aware local search pass on the returned schedule\n   - After beam search returns a full sequence, run a small neighborhood search using cached evaluations: adjacent swaps over a sliding window plus sampled insertions (e.g., 20\u201350 total moves, accept-if-improves, stop on 5 consecutive non-improves). Reuse the same cost_cache/\u0394-cache so most checks are incremental. Evidence: lightweight local improvement reliably adds gains without derailing runtime when construction is already strong.\n\n5. Make restarts deterministic and diversity-driven with structured seeding and adaptive widths\n   - Seed RNG deterministically per workload (e.g., seed = 1729 + workload.num_txns) for reproducibility, then ensure diversity by mixing initial beam seeds: include the k cheapest singletons, k largest singletons, and k random picks (k \u2248 beam_width/3 each). Vary beam_width/branch_factor across restarts to trade breadth vs. depth (e.g., first restart: beam=1.25\u00d7 default, branch=0.8\u00d7; second: default; third: beam=0.8\u00d7, branch=1.25\u00d7), keeping within the current min/max bounds. Evidence: random restarts helped robustness; controlling diversity and breadth adaptively should stabilize and occasionally surpass current best runs.",
    "1. Add deterministic, multi-restart beam runs with a shared memoized cache across restarts\n   - Run 2\u20133 short restarts of beam_search per workload, varying beam_width and cand_per_expand (e.g., [beam=16,cand=10], [12,14], [8,18]), then pick the best full schedule. Seed deterministically per workload (e.g., rng = random.Random(1729 + workload.num_txns)) and move cost_cache outside beam_search so it\u2019s reused across restarts; optionally wrap it in an LRU with ~200k entries. Evidence: shared caches and structured restarts consistently improved breadth and robustness in top performers; nondeterminism hurt A*-style attempts.\n\n2. Use W-guided surrogate prefiltering in VNS to expand neighborhoods without extra simulator calls\n   - Before evaluating a swap or relocate, score the move with a cheap surrogate: estimate \u0394W as the change in pairwise violation margins around the edited indices (using W). Only pass the top-k% (e.g., top 30\u201340%) surrogate-ranked moves in each VNS phase to evaluate_seq; keep a small random sample for diversity. Evidence: the best program\u2019s tournament guidance (W) excelled during construction\u2014extending it to filter local moves lets you try more candidates within the same budget.\n\n3. Tighten incumbents early with periodic greedy completions and lightweight incumbent-based pruning\n   - At each beam depth, greedily complete the top-1\u20132 prefixes using tournament_bubble_pass and W-ranked insertions to produce full sequences, update a global incumbent, and cache these costs. During expansion, skip adding child states whose immediate cost (evaluate_seq(seq+[t])) is already \u2265 incumbent (monotone in this setting), keeping a safe fallback path if all candidates are pruned. Evidence: early incumbents reduced wasted exploration in multiple correct programs; cheap greedy completions plus safe pruning lift effective beam quality without A*-style fragility.\n\n4. Introduce conflict-clustered blocks and block-aware moves guided by strong W edges\n   - Build a precedence DAG from W with edges i\u2192j when W[i][j] < \u2212\u03c4 (e.g., \u03c4 = percentile 70 of |W|), extract clusters via connected components, and initialize beam starts with cluster-respecting orders. Add block-level moves to VNS: swap two small clusters, or relocate a contiguous block centered on the most violated boundary (where prefer_before fails with large |W|). Evidence: leveraging strong pairwise preferences as soft constraints improves both construction and local refinement and scales better than random block choices.\n\n5. Depth- and conflict-adaptive lookahead with precomputed \u201cbuddy lists\u201d from M/W\n   - Precompute for each t a small buddy list B[t] of 5\u20138 transactions that pair best with t (e.g., smallest M[t][u] and/or most negative W[t][u]). In lookahead, expand L dynamically: L = 4\u20136 early (high branching) and shrink to 2 later, and choose u from B[t] \u2229 remaining first before falling back to preselect_by_tournament. Evidence: lightweight, bounded lookahead helped prune cheaply; biasing the second step to high-synergy pairs from M/W should improve ranking accuracy without many extra simulator calls.",
    "1. Add an incumbent-seeded, two-phase beam with safe pruning and periodic greedy completions\n   - Phase A: run a quick, broader beam (beam=16, cand=12, lookahead_top=4/next_k=6) for the first ~40% of depth, and at each depth greedily complete the top 2 prefixes using tournament_bubble_pass + W-ranked insertions to update a global incumbent. Phase B: rerun the beam from depth d with tighter params (beam=10, cand=8, lookahead_top=3/next_k=5) and prune any child whose immediate cost evaluate_seq(seq+[t]) \u2265 incumbent; keep a deterministic fallback if all are pruned. This leverages the best program\u2019s lookahead and W guidance while safely reducing search after a strong incumbent is found.\n\n2. Introduce prefix-dominance pruning keyed by (remaining, last-k suffix)\n   - Maintain a map best[(frozenset(remaining), tuple(seq[-k:]))] = lowest cost seen; when expanding, skip any state with equal signature and higher cost (k=3\u20134 works well). This extends the current dedup (prefix+remaining) with a dominance notion that collapses redundant frontiers and retains diversity, mirroring incumbent-style pruning seen in other high scorers.\n\n3. Depth-adaptive lookahead plus buddy-biased second step using precomputed M/W\n   - Build for each t a buddy list B[t] of 6\u20138 txns that minimize M[t][u] (and/or most negative W[t][u]); in lookahead, choose u from B[t] \u2229 remaining first. Use depth-adaptive settings: early L=4/next_k=6, mid L=3/5, late L=2/4, and shrink recent_k from 5\u21923 over depth to balance global and local signals. This preserves the best program\u2019s shallow lookahead but improves its accuracy and speed by focusing on high-synergy pairs.\n\n4. Tournament-guided, block-aware VNS with \u0394W gating and boundary-focused ruin-and-recreate\n   - For swaps/relocates, compute a cheap surrogate \u0394W from W around edited indices and only fully evaluate the top 35\u201340% moves per phase, plus ~10% random for diversity. For ruin-and-recreate, pick the block around the most violated adjacency (argmax |W[a][b]| where prefer_before fails), internally tournament-bubble the removed block, then try only the top-3 reinsertion positions predicted by local \u0394W. Add one block-swap neighborhood (swap two blocks of size 3\u20136 selected at violated boundaries) before relocates to unlock non-local improvements with limited calls.\n\n5. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared memo and parameter perturbations\n   - Run 2\u20133 short restarts per workload with shared cost_cache/M/W and fixed seeds (e.g., rng = random.Random(1729 + workload.num_txns + r)), then VNS the best two schedules. Vary key knobs per restart: (beam,cand,lookahead_top,next_k,recent_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6,5), (12,14,3,5,4), (10,10,3,4,3)}. This exploits the best program\u2019s cache-centric design to cheaply broaden exploration while keeping results reproducible and robust.",
    "1. Add a safe, incumbent-pruned two-phase beam inside beam_seed\n   - Phase A (broad): beam=16, cand_per_expand=12, lookahead_top=4, next_k=6 up to depth ~0.4n, greedily complete the top 2 prefixes each depth to update incumbent as you already do. Phase B (focused): beam=10, cand_per_expand=8, lookahead_top=3, next_k=5; for each expanded child t, run a fast greedy_complete(seq+[t]) for the top 4 children and prune any whose full cost \u2265 incumbent_cost; guarantee progress by always keeping the best child even if pruned. This extends the current beam\u2019s strength with safe pruning (full-sequence bounds only), mirroring the beam-seed quality gains seen in top programs.\n\n2. Promote prefix-dominance to a global map and apply it in the greedy constructor\n   - Maintain a shared dom[(frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix[-3:]))] = best_cost across both beam_seed and build_initial_sequence, and skip expansions that do not improve this key. In build_initial_sequence, before evaluating a candidate t, compute sig for seq+[t]; if cost \u2265 dom[sig], skip; every 10 steps, greedily complete the current prefix to possibly raise a global incumbent and early-terminate if eval_seq(seq) \u2265 incumbent. This directly leverages the dominance/duplication patterns that boosted beam quality in the best program and reduces redundant expansions in the greedy phase.\n\n3. Strengthen LNS with \u0394W-gated block neighborhoods (block-swap and block-reinsert)\n   - At each LNS iteration, in addition to current window permutations and relocations, try: (a) block-swap two blocks of size 3\u20136 centered on the top-2 worst violated adjacencies (by M[a][b]-M[b][a]); (b) remove a hot block (size 4\u20136) and reinsert it at the top-3 positions predicted by local \u0394W improvement. For each neighborhood, rank candidates by a cheap \u0394W surrogate computed from W around edited indices, fully evaluate only the top 35\u201340% plus ~10% random; cap total move evals per LNS round to ~500\u2013800. This adds non-local improvements that align with boundary-focused gains while keeping evaluation counts controlled.\n\n4. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering\n   - In both the greedy builder and beam expansion, shrink recent_k with depth (early: 5, mid: 4, late: 3) and set lookahead_top/next_k to (early: 4/6, mid: 3/5, late: 2/4). Add an anti-buddy filter: when the last placed x strongly \u201cdislikes\u201d t (W[x][t] > 0 and in the top quartile), deprioritize t unless its immediate eval beats the best candidate by \u22651% to allow escapes. For the single best immediate child at each step, probe a third step using buddies and tournament preselection (k=4) to refine ranking; this keeps pools small and accurate per the successful tournament+buddy pattern.\n\n5. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared memo and LNS on the top two\n   - Run 3 restarts with rng seeds rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r) to remove variance, sharing the same cost_cache/M/W. Use parameter perturbations per restart: (beam,cand,lookahead_top,next_k,recent_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6,5), (12,14,3,5,4), (10,10,3,4,3)}; perform full LNS only on the best two completed schedules. This exploits the cache-centric design to broaden exploration cheaply and mirrors the robustness gains observed when beam-seed quality and exploration budget were emphasized.",
    "1. Add a safe two-phase beam inside beam_seed with incumbent-pruned expansion\n   - Implement Phase A (broad): beam=16, cand_per_expand=12, lookahead_top=4, next_k=6 up to depth \u22480.4n; Phase B (focused): beam=10, cand_per_expand=8, lookahead_top=3, next_k=5. For each expanded child in both phases, greedily complete the top 2\u20134 children and prune any whose full greedy_complete cost \u2265 incumbent; always retain the best child to guarantee progress. Keep the current W/buddy preselection, but tighten dominance (suffix<=3) and reuse one dom map across both phases.\n\n2. Promote prefix-dominance to a global map and use it in both beam_seed and build_initial_sequence\n   - Hoist dom to the outer scope and key it as dom[(frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix[-3:]))] = best_prefix_cost; skip evaluating seq+[t] if its prefix cost \u2265 dom[key]. In build_initial_sequence, every 8\u201310 steps call greedy_complete on the current prefix to try to raise a global incumbent and early-terminate if eval_seq(prefix) \u2265 incumbent; before pushing a candidate t, precompute the signature for prefix+[t] and abort if dominated. This mirrors the best program\u2019s beam pruning and will cut duplicate expansions in the greedy constructor.\n\n3. Strengthen LNS with \u0394W-gated block-swap and block-reinsert moves\n   - Inside lns_improve, after the current window-permutation loop, add two neighborhoods: (a) block-swap two blocks of size 3\u20136 centered on the top-2 worst violated adjacencies by M[a][b]-M[b][a]; (b) remove a hot block (size 4\u20136) and reinsert it at the top-3 positions ranked by a \u0394W surrogate computed from recent_k=3 context around the insertion site. For each neighborhood, rank candidates by the \u0394W surrogate, fully evaluate only the top 35\u201340% plus ~10% random, and cap total new evals per LNS round to 600\u2013800. This adds non-local improvements while staying faithful to the boundary-focused, W-guided gains.\n\n4. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both builders\n   - Make recent_k and lookahead pools depth-aware: early (depth < 0.25n): recent_k=5, lookahead_top/next_k=4/6; mid (0.25\u20130.7n): 4 and 3/5; late: 3 and 2/4. Add an anti-buddy filter: if the last placed x strongly disfavors t (W[x][t] > 0 and in the top quartile of W[x]), deprioritize t unless its immediate eval is within 1% of the current best; for the single best immediate child, probe a third step with buddies (next_k=4). Apply this in both build_initial_sequence and beam_seed expansion to keep candidate pools small and accurate.\n\n5. Deterministic restart portfolio sharing the unified cache, with LNS on the top two seeds\n   - Run 3 restarts with rng seeds rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r) while sharing cost_cache, M, W, and buddies across restarts. Use parameter perturbations per restart: (beam,cand,lookahead_top,next_k,recent_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6,5), (12,14,3,5,4), (10,10,3,4,3)}; perform full lns_improve only on the best two completed schedules by greedy_complete. This widens exploration cheaply due to shared memoization and aligns with the tournament+beam+LNS hybrids\u2019 robustness gains.",
    "1. Hoist prefix-dominance to a global map and reuse it across both beam_seed and the greedy constructor\n   - Replace the local dom inside beam_seed with the existing prefix_dom and key it as (frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix[-3:])) -> best_prefix_cost. Before pushing any child new_seq, skip if its prefix cost \u2265 prefix_dom[key], and update the map otherwise. Also, every 8\u201310 greedy steps call greedy_complete on the current prefix to try to raise a global incumbent and early-terminate if eval_seq(prefix) \u2265 incumbent.\n\n2. Add \u0394W-gated block-swap and block-reinsert neighborhoods to LNS with ranked evaluation\n   - After the current window-permutation loop, add: (a) block-swap between two blocks of size 3\u20136 centered on the top-2 worst M[a][b] - M[b][a] adjacencies; (b) remove a hot block (size 4\u20136) and reinsert it at the top-3 positions ranked by a \u0394W surrogate using recent_k=3 context. For each neighborhood, fully evaluate only the top 35\u201340% candidates by \u0394W plus ~10% random, and cap total new seq_cost calls per LNS round to 600\u2013800 to stay within time budgets.\n\n3. Incumbent-aware greedy completion at child expansion within the beam\n   - In beam_seed, for each node\u2019s top-K children (K=2\u20134) by immediate or lookahead metric, run greedy_complete(new_seq, new_rem) and prune the child if its full completion cost \u2265 incumbent. Always keep at least the single best child to avoid empty beams. This mirrors Gen58\u2019s mid-beam tightening but moves it one step earlier, improving pruning and seed quality before LNS.\n\n4. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both builders\n   - Use recent_k = 5/4/3 for early/mid/late depths and set lookahead_top/next_k = 4/6 (early), 3/5 (mid), 2/4 (late). Add an anti-buddy filter: if the last placed x strongly disfavors t (W[x][t] > 0 and within the top quartile of W[x]), downweight or skip t unless its immediate metric is within 1% of the current best. For the single best immediate child at each step, probe one extra lookahead layer (depth-3) with buddies next_k=4 to resolve ties cheaply.\n\n5. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 restarts with seeds rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r), sharing cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across runs. Use parameter perturbations per restart: (beam,cand_per_expand,lookahead_top,next_k,recent_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6,5), (12,14,3,5,4), (10,10,3,4,3)}, and perform full lns_improve only on the top two seeds by greedy_complete. Keep the cheap tournament-bubble and adjacent passes before/after LNS in each selected run to tighten makespan with low overhead.",
    "1. Hoist and unify prefix-dominance across beam and greedy, and periodically promote the incumbent in greedy\n   - Replace the local dom in beam_seed with the existing prefix_dom keyed as (frozenset(remaining), tuple(prefix[-3:])) and reuse it to skip child expansions whose prefix cost \u2265 stored best. In the greedy restarts, every 8\u201310 steps run greedy_complete on the current prefix; if its completion cost improves the incumbent, update it and early-terminate branches with base_cost \u2265 incumbent. This mirrors the incumbent-aware dominance that\u2019s driving top-tier pruning efficiency in Gen60/61 and the current best.\n\n2. Add \u0394W-gated block-swap and block-reinsert neighborhoods to LNS with ranked, capped evaluation\n   - After the current window-permutation loop, add: (a) block-swap between two disjoint blocks of size 3\u20136 centered on the top-2 worst M[a][b] - M[b][a] adjacencies; (b) remove a hot block (size 4\u20136) and reinsert it at the top-3 positions ranked by a \u0394W surrogate using recent_k=3 context. For each neighborhood, fully evaluate only the top 35\u201340% candidates by \u0394W plus ~10% random, and cap total seq_cost calls per LNS round to 600\u2013800 to keep runtime predictable; this boundary-focused, surrogate-gated refinement is repeatedly credited for final gains in Gen60/61.\n\n3. Incumbent-aware greedy completion at child expansion within the beam\n   - In beam_seed, for each parent\u2019s top-K children (K=2\u20133) by immediate/lookahead metric, run greedy_complete(new_seq, new_rem) and prune the child if its full completion cost \u2265 incumbent; always keep at least the single best child to avoid empty beams. This moves the incumbent promotion one step earlier than your current \u201ctop-2 beam items per depth\u201d tightening and has consistently improved seed quality and pruning in the best performers.\n\n4. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both builders\n   - Use recent_k = 5/4/3 for early/mid/late depths and set (lookahead_top, next_k) = (4,6) early, (3,5) mid, (2,4) late, applied to both beam and greedy. Add an anti-buddy filter: if the last placed x strongly disfavors t (W[x][t] > 0 and within the top quartile of W[x]), skip t unless its immediate metric is within 1% of the current best; for the single best immediate child, probe one extra depth (depth-3) using buddies next_k=4. This focuses evaluations on high-yield extensions without inflating budgets, matching patterns from Gen60/61 and the current best.\n\n5. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 deterministic restarts with rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r), sharing cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across runs. Use parameter perturbations per restart, e.g., (beam_width, cand_per_expand, lookahead_top, next_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6), (12,14,3,5), (10,10,3,4)}, and perform full lns_improve only on the best two seeds by greedy_complete; keep cheap tournament-bubble and adjacent passes on all seeds. This portfolio pattern preserved determinism and delivered consistent lifts within tight budgets in Gen60/61.",
    "1. Unify prefix-dominance across beam and greedy, and promote the incumbent at child expansion\n   - Replace the local dom in beam_seed with the shared prefix_dom keyed as (frozenset(remaining), suffix\u22643 early, suffix\u22644 after 70% depth). For the top K children per parent (K=2 early, 1 late), run greedy_complete(new_seq, new_rem) and prune the child if its completion cost \u2265 incumbent; update incumbent when improved. In greedy restarts, every 8\u201310 steps invoke greedy_complete on the current prefix and early-terminate if base_cost \u2265 incumbent to propagate tighter bounds sooner.\n\n2. Add \u0394W-gated block-swap and block-reinsert neighborhoods to LNS with a strict evaluation cap\n   - After window permutations and relocations, add: (a) block-swap between two disjoint blocks of size 3\u20135 centered on the top-2 worst violated adjacencies; (b) remove a hot block (size 4\u20136) and reinsert it at the top-3 positions ranked by a \u0394W surrogate using recent_k=3 context. Evaluate only the top 35\u201340% candidates by \u0394W plus 10% random, enforce a per-round seq_cost cap of 600\u2013800 with early exit, and accept the first improving move to maintain predictability.\n\n3. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both builders\n   - Use recent_k = 5/4/3 for early/mid/late depths and set (lookahead_top, next_k) = (4,6) early, (3,5) mid, (2,4) late in both beam and greedy. Add an anti-buddy guard: if the last placed x strongly disfavors t (W[x][t] above the 75th percentile for row x), skip t unless its metric is within 1% of the current best; for the single best immediate child, probe one extra depth (depth-3) with buddies next_k=4. This concentrates expansions on high-yield continuations while avoiding known-bad adjacencies.\n\n4. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 deterministic restarts with rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r), reusing cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across runs. Vary beam parameters per restart, e.g., (beam_width, cand_per_expand, lookahead_top, next_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6), (12,14,3,5), (10,10,3,4)}, and apply full lns_improve only to the best two seeds by greedy_complete; keep the tournament-bubble and adjacent passes on all seeds. This preserves determinism and broadens exploration without blowing the budget.\n\n5. Strengthen boundary-focused LNS with anchored windows and a targeted 2.5-opt \u201cbridge\u201d move\n   - When selecting windows, include \u201canchored\u201d boundary windows that fix one boundary element and permute the interior around the worst violated adjacency, and increase k=7 sampling from 2000 to up to 3000 permutations only if the per-round seq_cost budget remains >40%. Add a bridge move: choose the worst (a,b) adjacency, take a block around b (size 3\u20135), optionally reverse it, and reinsert just before a if a \u0394W surrogate predicts gain; run a quick tournament_bubble_pass after each accepted move to lock in improvements.",
    "1. Unify prefix-dominance across beam and greedy, and promote children with greedy completion\n   - Replace the local dom in beam_seed with the shared prefix_dom keyed by (frozenset(remaining), suffix), using suffix_k=3 until 70% depth and suffix_k=4 thereafter. For each expanded parent, run greedy_complete on the top K children by lookahead (K=2 for d/n<0.7, K=1 otherwise), prune the child if its greedy completion cost \u2265 incumbent, and update the incumbent when improved. Keep the existing per-depth \u201ccomplete top beam items\u201d step, but this child-level promotion tightens bounds earlier and drives stronger pruning.\n\n2. Strengthen boundary-focused LNS with anchored windows, \u0394W gating, bridge move, and a strict eval cap\n   - When selecting windows, include anchored windows that fix one boundary element around the worst violated adjacency (fix a or b, permute the k\u22121 interior) in addition to current marginal-sum windows. Before evaluating permutations, relocations, block-swaps, and block-reinserts, score candidates with a \u0394W surrogate and evaluate only the top 35\u201340% plus 10% random; enforce a per-round eval_seq cap of 600\u2013800 with early exit. Increase k=7 sampling from 2000 to up to 3000 only if the per-round cap hasn\u2019t been hit, add a \u201cbridge\u201d move that takes a block around b (size 3\u20135), optionally reverses it, and reinserts before a, and run tournament_bubble_pass after each accepted move.\n\n3. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both beam and greedy\n   - Set recent_k by stage: early/mid/late = 5/4/3, and (lookahead_top, next_k) = (4,6), (3,5), (2,4) respectively. Add an anti-buddy guard: if the last placed x has W[x][t] above the 75th percentile for row x, skip t unless its metric is within 1% of the best at that step; for the single best immediate child, run one extra depth probe (evaluate min over next_k=4 buddies for depth+2). This concentrates expansions on high-yield continuations while avoiding known-bad adjacencies.\n\n4. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 deterministic restarts with rng = Random(1729 + n*31 + r) and reuse cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across restarts. Vary beam parameters per restart, e.g., (beam_width, cand_per_expand, lookahead_top, next_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6), (12,14,3,5), (10,10,2,4)}, and apply full lns_improve only to the best two seeds by greedy_complete; keep tournament_bubble_pass and adjacent_pass on all seeds. This stabilizes outcomes, broadens exploration, and keeps runtime within budget.\n\n5. Replace late-stage random two-opt/insertion with conflict-targeted 2.5-opt sampling\n   - Build a candidate set from the top-\u03ba worst violated adjacencies (\u03ba=20 or n//8): for each (a,b) at positions i,i+1, sample j far from i and evaluate either swapping non-adjacent endpoints (2-opt) or extracting a short block around b (size 3\u20134) and reinserting before a (2.5-opt). Rank candidates by \u0394W = (W[a][b] + W[seq[j]][seq[j+1]]) and evaluate only the top 40% plus 10% random under a small budget (e.g., 50\u201380 trials), accepting the first improving move. This targets non-local fixes likely to reduce the heaviest conflicts more efficiently than uniform random swaps/inserts.",
    "1. Share prefix-dominance across beam and greedy and add child-level greedy promotion\n   - Replace beam\u2019s local dom with the global prefix_dom keyed by (frozenset(remaining), suffix), using suffix_k=3 until 70% depth and suffix_k=4 after. For each expanded parent, run greedy_complete on the top K children by lookahead (K=2 for early/mid depth, K=1 late); prune a child if its greedy-completion cost \u2265 incumbent and update incumbent on improvement. Keep the existing \u201ccomplete top beam items\u201d step; this tightens bounds earlier and reduces expansions, mirroring what worked in top scorers.\n\n2. Upgrade boundary-focused LNS with anchored windows, \u0394W gating, bridge move, and a strict eval cap\n   - When choosing hot windows, add anchored windows around worst-violated adjacencies: fix a or b and permute the k\u22121 interior; keep current marginal-sum windows. Before eval_seq, compute a \u0394W surrogate for candidates (permutations/relocates/block-swaps/reinserts) and evaluate only the top 35\u201340% by \u0394W plus 10% random; enforce a per-round eval_seq cap of 700 with early exit. Raise k=7 sampling to up to 3000 only if the cap hasn\u2019t been hit, add a \u201cbridge\u201d move that extracts a block around b (size 3\u20135), optionally reverses it, and reinserts before a, and run tournament_bubble_pass immediately after any accepted move.\n\n3. Depth- and context-adaptive lookahead with anti-buddy filtering in both beam and greedy\n   - Set recent_k by stage: early/mid/late = 5/4/3, and (lookahead_top, next_k) = (4,6), (3,5), (2,4) respectively. Add an anti-buddy guard: if the last placed x has W[x][t] in the top 25% of its row, skip t unless its metric is within 1% of the best at that step; for the single best immediate child, probe one extra depth by minimizing over next_k=4 buddies at depth+2. Apply this uniformly in beam expansion and the greedy builder to concentrate on high-yield continuations while avoiding known-bad adjacencies.\n\n4. Deterministic restart portfolio with shared caches and selective LNS\n   - Run 3 deterministic restarts with rng = Random(1729 + r) and reuse cost_cache, M, W, buddies, and prefix_dom across restarts. Vary beam parameters per restart, e.g., (beam_width, cand_per_expand, lookahead_top, next_k) \u2208 {(16,12,4,6), (12,14,3,5), (10,10,2,4)}, and apply full lns_improve only to the best two seeds by greedy_complete; keep tournament_bubble_pass and adjacent_pass on all seeds. Add a simple per-restart early-stop: if no improvement after 2 LNS iterations, skip remaining LNS for that restart to keep within budget.\n\n5. Replace late random two-opt/insertion with conflict-targeted 2.5-opt sampling\n   - Build a candidate set from the top-\u03ba worst violated adjacencies (\u03ba = min(20, n//8)); for each (a,b) at positions i,i+1, sample j far from i and evaluate either swapping non-adjacent endpoints (2-opt) or extracting a short block around b (size 3\u20134) and reinserting before a (2.5-opt). Rank candidates by \u0394W = (W[a][b] + W[seq[j]][seq[j+1]]), evaluate only the top 40% plus 10% random under a small budget (50\u201380 trials), and accept the first improving move. This targets the heaviest conflicts more efficiently than uniform two-opt/insertion and aligns with the boundary-aware gains seen in the best program."
