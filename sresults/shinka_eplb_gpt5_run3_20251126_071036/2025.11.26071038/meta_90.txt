# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer for vLLM**
- **Implementation**: Implements a greedy, hierarchical rearrangement using PyTorch: groups are packed to nodes, experts replicated within nodes, and physical experts packed to GPUs via a balanced_packing heuristic, with permutations managed by scatter/gather and an inverse mapping. Computation is performed primarily on CPU (weight.float().cpu()) with per-layer greedy choices and fixed replica counts used to build phy→log, log→phy, and expert count maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy packing and CPU-based tensor ops, but yields only moderate load balance. Hierarchical constraints and per-layer greedy decisions (e.g., weight/logcnt replication and group-first packing) likely limit balancedness compared to more global or optimal assignments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical strategy: groups→nodes via balanced packing, per-node “water-filling” replication, and diversity-aware greedy assignment of replicas to GPUs that minimizes label collocation while equalizing per-pack load; permutation inverses and scatter build physical↔logical maps. Trivial/fast paths (e.g., one item per pack, no-duplicate labels) and CPU-friendly loops via list conversions keep overhead low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The diversity-aware step reduces hotspotting of identical labels, but the equal-items-per-pack constraint and greedy choices yield only moderate load balance. Efficient early exits and lightweight loops drive the top speed score.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name diversity_aware_gpu_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy sort-based bin packing per layer with a small local 2-opt-style refinement between heaviest/lightest packs. Replication is selected via argmax(weight/logcnt) within nodes, then replicas are packed to GPUs; final mappings are built via gather/scatter and inverse permutations, operating on CPU tensors for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306805, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed shows the greedy + limited refinement is lightweight, but moderate balancedness indicates room for stronger global balancing. More refinement iterations or smarter swap selection could improve balance; hierarchical policy is used when groups align with nodes, otherwise a global fallback is applied.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name local_swap_refine_in_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Serpentine Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses vectorized serpentine (snake) packing per layer to evenly assign sorted experts to packs, and a d'Hondt-like greedy replicator that allocates extra replicas by weight/count. A hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs using amortized loads, implemented with PyTorch scatter/gather and permutation inverses (with a fast path when groups_per_pack==1).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.63 (balancedness 0.254285, speed 1.00; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Fully vectorized design achieves maximal speed but modest balancedness, suggesting the greedy replication plus snake packing underperform under skewed loads. Correctness is solid (passes all tests); balancedness may improve with local swap/refinement or more global optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name eplb_snake_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Diversity-Aware Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical three-stage pipeline: (1) greedy group-to-node packing with up to 4 heaviest/lightest swaps, (2) per-node expert replication via an incremental ratio (weight/count) greedy update, and (3) GPU placement with diversity-aware packing that prioritizes label spread then projected load. Mapping inverses and placements are built via scatter/gather for efficiency, with selective CPU sorting and minimal refinement to keep runtime low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.3068, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests. It prioritizes speed—greedy choices and limited local refinement yield maximal runtime performance but only moderate balance; diversity-aware packing helps reduce hotspotting, though the capped refinements likely limit balancedness gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name diverse_pack_projload_and_incremental_ratio - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical strategy: groups are packed to nodes via balanced_packing, logical experts are replicated with Hamilton’s method (largest remainder) in replicate_experts, and physical experts are assigned to GPUs using a diversity-aware greedy packer that spreads identical labels to reduce hotspotting. Mappings are built with vectorized torch ops (scatter/inverse), and the top-level casts weights to CPU for consistent, fast execution.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.2897, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy policies and vectorized construction of mappings, but balancedness is modest, indicating the greedy packing and proportional replication may under-serve heavy experts or miss global optimality. Consider stronger global balancing heuristics or improved tie-breaking beyond label diversity to raise balancedness without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name proportional_quota_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs logical expert groups to nodes, greedily replicates experts within nodes, then balances physical experts across GPUs. The core balanced_packing uses per-layer greedy assignment with fixed per-pack item counts and a lightweight single-swap refinement; replicate_experts greedily allocates by current load (weight/logcnt), and mappings are built via scatter/gather operations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy passes and minimal refinement, but achieves only moderate balance. Single-swap local improvement and equal-cardinality packing likely cap balancedness; nevertheless, the solution is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name single_swap_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and D’Hondt Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer (sort-by-weight, place into lightest pack) with a single heaviest↔lightest swap refinement and deterministic in-pack ranks; replica allocation is a vectorized D’Hondt-style water-filling. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes and GPUs via permutation ops (including a scatter-based inverse), with replication done per node and final mappings produced by gather/scatter.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The lightweight greedy packing favors speed but leaves noticeable imbalance; increasing refinement steps or applying smarter swap/refinement strategies could raise balancedness with modest cost. Vectorized allocation and permutation-based layout keep the approach simple and fast, and all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name moe_eplb_modular_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer greedy balanced_packing (descending sort with capacity-constrained assignment) plus up to two bounded heavy-light swaps to reduce imbalance while reassigning ranks. Applies a hierarchical strategy: pack groups to nodes, greedily replicate experts via weight/logcnt, then pack physical experts to GPUs; mappings are constructed via gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed from lightweight greedy steps and limited refinement, but modest balancedness suggests under-optimization of load distribution. More aggressive or global refinement could improve balance at the expense of speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name multi_swap_refinement_balanced_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: RR-WF Packing with Hare Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements Round-Robin Waterfilling packing to assign items to packs in capacity rounds, with a lightweight post-swap refinement; uses Hare (Hamilton) largest-remainder to allocate replicas proportionally, then a hierarchical pipeline (group→node packing, intra-node replication, GPU packing) built with vectorized torch gathers/scatters and an inverse-permutation utility. The entry rebalance forces weight to float().cpu() and selects hierarchical when groups % nodes == 0, otherwise a global fallback.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.289706, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple per-round vectorized ops, stable sorting, and minimal refinement; per-row loops (remainders/topk, final swap) are lightweight. Balance is improved over naive strategies but remains moderate, suggesting headroom beyond the single-pass RR-WF plus optional one-swap refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name rr_waterfill_hare - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill + Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical balancer: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, intra-node water-filling replica allocation via binary search with greedy extras, and GPU placement using a diversity-aware heap that minimizes (label repeats, load, fill). It builds contiguous phy2log/rank with repeat_interleave, inverts mappings where needed, and scatters logical→physical indices; falls back to a single-node policy when groups aren’t node-aligned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000) across 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU sorts, vectorized gathers/scatters, and simple greedy heuristics, but achieves only moderate balance. Balancedness likely suffers from the greedy capacity-constrained packers and per-node isolation; tuning the packing objective or more global optimization could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name waterfill_diverse_heap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diverse Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical packing of logical experts to nodes and GPUs: greedy capacity-constrained packing with K=2 heavy–light swaps, diversity-aware packing to spread identical labels, and a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replication strategy. Uses vectorized gathers/scatters and invert-permutation helpers to build physical↔logical maps and replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.304918, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: All tests passed; packing and replication are fast, yielding top speed but only moderate balance. The limited K=2 refinement and local (per-node) swaps likely cap balancedness despite diversity-aware placement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: packs expert groups to nodes with capacity-aware LPT, performs per-node water-filling replication with a one-step donor→receiver fix, then assigns to GPUs via a diversity-aware heap plus a k=2 swap refinement. Builds physical→logical and logical→physical maps via scatter/gather with contiguous replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent, indicating low overhead from the greedy/heap steps and CPU tensor ops. Balancedness is modest, suggesting the single-step fix and limited 2-opt swap cap equalization, leaving room for deeper refinement if needed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert-parallel balancer: groups are greedily packed to nodes with a bounded multi-swap refinement (max_swaps=2), replicas are allocated per layer via a D’Hondt-like scheme with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, and physical experts are then packed to GPUs; mappings use gather/scatter with inverse permutations for determinism. Packing operates on CPU tensors with stable rank reassignment to maintain per-pack ordering.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy heuristics and tightly bounded refinement, but balancedness is moderate, likely limited by the two-swap bound and single-step replica fix-up. Hierarchical placement benefits topology-aware locality when groups are node-divisible; otherwise it falls back to a global policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name replication_fixup_one_step - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer sorted greedy balanced_packing with exact items-per-pack and a bounded (max 2) multi-swap refinement to reduce imbalance. Replication applies a D’Hondt-like greedy allocation plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs with inverse maps and stable ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed but moderate balancedness, likely limited by the small swap budget and single-step replication correction. The hierarchical policy preserves locality and determinism; increasing refinement steps could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name one_step_replication_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB Hybrid Hierarchical Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical expert balancing with a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replica apportionment (plus a one-step fix-up), greedy capacity-constrained packing with k=2 best-improvement swaps, and a diversity-aware GPU assignment tie-breaker. Uses permutation inversion utilities and staged refinement (1 step for groups→nodes, 2 steps for physical→GPU packing).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The replica fix-up moves a seat from the highest-average “donor” to the lowest-average “receiver,” which worsens imbalance (direction should be receiver→donor), likely breaking correctness. Additionally, layout reshaping/gather assumes block-contiguous permutations and the forced .cpu() cast may violate expected device semantics, contributing to failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name hydra_k2_diversity_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses capacity-constrained greedy packing over sorted weights with bounded multi-swap refinement; hierarchical grouping packs groups→nodes and replicas→GPUs via inverse-permutation mappings. Replication applies a D’Hondt allocation with a Sainte-Laguë tail and a single donor→receiver fix-up, with deterministic rank reassignment.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65; balancedness_score 0.304918, speed_score 1.000000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: The limited refinement (refine_steps=1–2) and one-step fix-up prioritize speed but leave noticeable imbalance. Increasing swap iterations or applying richer local search could improve balancedness at some runtime cost; all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallel Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: packs expert groups to nodes via greedy balanced_packing with bounded multi-swap refinement, replicates experts using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) allocator plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, then packs physical replicas to GPUs. Uses CPU-based sorting/scatter and stable rank reassignment, with inverse mappings for logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the greedy, bounded-swap design and CPU-side ops keep overhead low. Balancedness is moderate, likely constrained by the single-step replica fix-up and small refine_steps; allowing more refinement or multi-move adjustments could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_specific_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diversity-Aware EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Performs hierarchical load balancing: packs expert groups to nodes with greedy balanced packing, replicates experts per node by max normalized load, then assigns replicas to GPUs using diversity-aware greedy packing with a single k=2 best-improvement swap; mappings use vectorized gather/scatter for efficiency. Includes a fast path when labels are unique and tie-breakers to reduce label duplication per pack.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; the diversity-aware greedy plus minimal refinement achieves excellent speed but only moderate balance. More aggressive refinement (multi-swap or iterative improvement) could raise balancedness, though current design already reduces hotspotting from replica co-location.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name k2_micro_swap_diverse - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and hybrid apportionment**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs groups to nodes, replicates experts within nodes using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a one-step fix-up, then assigns physical experts to GPUs via balanced packing. The packing is a sorted greedy placement with capacity constraints plus bounded local multi-swap refinement; mappings are constructed with gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validation tests. Excellent speed due to bounded refinement and lightweight apportionment, while moderate balancedness indicates potential gains from higher refine_steps or multi-iteration replication adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name refine_packing_and_hybrid_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- Implementation: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with per-layer targeted heavy-light swaps (searchsorted-based) determines group/node/GPU placement; a hierarchical layout uses permutation inverses to keep groups contiguous and then packs per-GPU experts after replication. Replication employs hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; deterministic intra-pack ranks and vectorized torch ops are used throughout.
- Performance: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000, 5 workloads).
- Feedback: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; limited refinement steps and the single-step replication fix-up likely cap balancedness. Increasing refine_steps or enabling multi-swap/multi-move adjustments could improve balance at some cost in speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name moe_eplb_crossover_capacityperm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical staging: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, water-filling replication per node with a top-2 donor/bottom-2 receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a k=2 swap refinement. Physical↔logical maps and ranks are built via repeat_interleave and scatter/gather with exact per-pack capacities.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and fast, but balancedness is only moderate, suggesting the greedy packing and limited local refinements reduce peaks but don’t fully equalize load. Stronger global adjustments could further improve balance without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name top2_replica_fix_and_tieaware_pack - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and quota replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps and an adaptive second swap; replication allocates via a D’Hondt bulk phase followed by per-row Sainte-Laguë vs Huntington–Hill selection and a single-move donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical policy packs groups to nodes and physical experts to GPUs, with fast permutation inverses and scatter-based map construction and deterministic in-pack ranking.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306257, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Minimal refinement and simple scans preserve peak speed but cap balance quality; adaptive tail sizing (via coefficient of variation) and hierarchical staging improve robustness. The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name eplb_k2swap_hybrid_apportion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a bounded k=2 heaviest-lightest swap refinement, combined with hierarchical node/group/GPU placement. Replication uses a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a single best-improving donor→receiver fix-up to reduce peak average load.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The algorithm is very fast due to greedy packing and limited local refinement, but balancedness is modest, suggesting the k=2 swap and single fix-up move under-correct skew. Increasing refine_steps, considering larger swap candidate sets, or multiple fix-up iterations could improve balance at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name adaptive_refine_and_replication_fixup_k2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with k-swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-stage balancer: groups-to-nodes via greedy packing plus bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, intra-node expert replication using apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail) with a one-move fix-up, then GPU packing with a diversity-aware tie-break; deterministic ranking and inverse-permutation utilities included. Core loops run on CPU for control flow, with small-k refinement and optional adaptive second swap for improved local balance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Achieves maximal speed due to lightweight CPU-driven greedy packing and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest. Increasing refine_steps/k, strengthening swap search, or more aggressive diversity penalties could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name dhh_diverse_k2_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB: Hierarchical Hybrid Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a CPU-friendly greedy balanced_packing with per-layer sort, capacity-aware assignment, and bounded heaviest-lightest refinement swaps; replicate_experts applies a hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical rebalancing packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs replicas to GPUs, with permutation inverses and rank-aware log2phy scatter for final maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy CPU paths and limited refinement, while balancedness is modest likely due to small refine_steps and single-step replication fix-up. The hierarchical policy favors locality and stability but may under-balance globally in some distributions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name moe_eplb_hybrid_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Staged pipeline: GroupPacker does LPT-style greedy packing with a bounded k=2 best-improvement swap; ReplicaAllocator apportions replicas via D’Hondt bulk then A/B between Sainte-Laguë and Huntington–Hill with a single donor→receiver correction; GpuPlacer uses greedy projected-load assignment with a diversity-aware tie-breaker and adaptive k=2 refinement. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes, allocates within nodes, then places to GPUs, with a global fallback when grouping doesn’t align with nodes.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.299, speed 1.000) over 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Perfect speed shows the heuristics are lightweight and implementation efficient, while modest balancedness suggests the greedy choices and single bounded swaps leave residual imbalance. The apportionment tail improves peak per-replica averages and the diversity tie-breaker helps spread replicas, but limited refinement likely caps balancing quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name eplb_pipeline_apportion_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical 3-step pipeline: capacity-aware LPT packing of groups to nodes, per-(layer,node) water-filling replication with a small donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with a unique-label fast path and a single 2-opt swap; mappings are built via vectorized torch gather/scatter with contiguous ranks per expert. Assumes exact per-pack capacity and enforces at least one replica per logical expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is fast due to simple sorts, limited local refinements, and lightweight CPU tensor ops, but balancedness is modest, likely bounded by the greedy packing and shallow (k≤2) fix-ups. Deeper refinement or broader swap searches could improve balance at a small runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name moe_eplb_waterfill_diverse_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with zig-zag packing and water-filling**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical balancer: groups are stripe-packed (zig-zag) to nodes, experts replicated in-node via water-filling (binary search + greedy rounding), and replicas stripe-packed to GPUs using per-replica average load; mappings are built with scatter/gather and permutation inverses for deterministic phy2log/log2phy. Runs on CPU tensors, enforces exact per-pack capacity, and ignores refine_steps in packing for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.310534, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads; all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; the single-pass stripe packing and batched rounding in water-filling (full-round increments before top-k) likely cap balance quality. Iterative refinement or stricter marginal-benefit allocation for remaining replicas could improve balancedness without large runtime penalties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name waterfill_stripe_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with K-swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, plus a diversity-aware tie-break for near-ties. Hierarchical pipeline: pack groups to nodes, replicate via vectorized minimax with a one-move fix-up, then pack replicas to GPUs; outputs deterministic ranks and mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.308909, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed comes from lightweight CPU control flow and vectorized allocation steps, but the small k and swap budget bias toward speed over balance, resulting in modest balancedness. Increasing refine_steps/k or strengthening the post-allocation fix-up could improve balance; the very small diversity penalty likely has limited impact.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name moe_eplb_minimax_replicator - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication and k-candidate refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing with fixed pack sizes and a bounded k=2 swap refinement to reduce per-pack imbalance, while maintaining stable in-pack ranks. Replication is allocated via a hybrid apportionment (D'Hondt bulk, Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a single best donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline maps groups→nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs, using gather/scatter inversion for mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement (k=2, max 2 swaps) and single-move fix-up keep it very fast but limit final balance quality. Increasing swap candidates/iterations or allowing multi-move adjustments could improve balancedness at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name k2_refine_and_stronger_replication_fix - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Waterfill and Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Uses water-filling replica allocation (binary search + greedy extras) with a small donor→receiver fix-up, hierarchical group-to-node LPT-like packing, and diversity-aware heap GPU placement with label-aware tie-breaking plus bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps; mappings are composed via gather/scatter with inverse permutations. Optimized fast paths exist for trivial capacities and unique labels, and ranks are kept contiguous per expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU tensor ops, constrained candidate sets, and early-exit paths, but achieves only moderate balance. Limited refinement depth (k=2 swaps, two fix-up iterations) and greedy packing likely leave headroom for improved peak smoothing, though the solution is correct and passes all validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name light2_and_pair_swap_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB with Diverse GPU Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical placement: group-to-node balanced packing (capacity-aware LPT), per-node water-filling replica allocation with a donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a bounded 1x1 swap refinement. Mapping is built via vectorized gather/scatter with contiguous replica ranks and robust edge-case handling (e.g., capacity=1, all-zero weights).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66; balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; excellent speed from greedy heuristics and minimal refinement. Balancedness is modest, likely limited by the single-step donor/receiver tweak and bounded 1x1 swap, indicating potential gains from deeper or iterative refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name replicate_fixup_and_light2_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical 3-stage balancer: groups→nodes via greedy packing with 1-step k×k refinement, intra-node replication using a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte-Laguë (tail selected by simulation) plus a capped 2-move fix-up, and GPU placement via diversity-aware packing with adaptive depth and optional 2×2 swaps. Deterministic ranks and inverse permutations ensure stable layouts; control-flow heavy parts run on CPU.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00) over 5 workloads; passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong speed stems from bounded k=2 candidate swaps and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest, likely due to 1-step refinement in group packing and disabled 2×2/second-light in the base pass. Increasing refine_steps or enabling broader light-pack candidates/2×2 in balanced_packing should improve balance with minimal impact on speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name moe_eplb_dualrefine_tailabc - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Diversity-aware hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical packing (groups→nodes, replicate within nodes, then pack to GPUs) with water-filling-based replication plus a donor→receiver fix-up, and a diversity-aware balanced packing that spreads identical labels and applies a single 1x1 swap refinement between heavy/light packs. Provides invertible mappings and ranks, with a CPU float normalization at the entry point for consistency.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.3111, speed_score 1.0; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy assignment and bounded refinement. Balancedness is moderate; the one-swap refinement and local greedy choices improve hotspots but leave headroom for further imbalance reduction. The program is correct and passed all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name waterfill_and_light_pair_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a targeted heaviest↔lightest swap (searchsorted-based) refinement; fast-path for capacity==1. Employs a hierarchical policy (groups→nodes), hybrid D’Hondt then Sainte-Laguë replication with a local fix-up move, and diversity-aware GPU packing with label-based tie-breaking and adaptive refinement; permutation inverses and scatters map between logical/meta/global IDs.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Lightweight refinement and greedy heuristics keep runtime excellent but leave balance suboptimal; increasing refinement steps or broader swap neighborhoods could improve balancedness. CPU staging in the diversity-aware step and Python loops did not impact this benchmark’s speed but may be a scalability consideration for larger inputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name eplb_hybrid_diverse_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Waterfill-Based Hierarchical vLLM Expert Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical placement: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, water-filling replica allocation with guarded donor→receiver fix-ups (up to two moves), and diversity-aware heap-based GPU packing with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps and adaptive refinement; builds physical↔logical maps via tensor gather/scatter with exact per-pack capacities and contiguous replica ranks. 
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement and capped fix-ups prioritize speed but limit balancedness improvements, leaving residual peak load after water-filling. Diversity-aware packing improves label spread, yet the conservative swap policy may under-optimize the global max load across GPUs.

Exact pack capacities are enforced, with permutation inverses used to map between logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.0 and failed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Results likely violate the expected output contract (e.g., forcing tensors to CPU in rebalance_experts, potential permutation/device mismatches), causing correctness failures. Preserve input device for outputs, verify permutation assumptions for inverse mappings, and ensure the hierarchical remapping and refinement steps produce bitwise-identical outputs to prior versions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name interleaved_zigzag_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: EPLB hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing per layer with bounded 1x1 and 2x2 swap refinement, and a hybrid replication scheme (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a small tail auto-tuning and per-row fix-up.

Control-flow-heavy steps run on CPU, with adaptive refinement depth based on imbalance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.309358, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Maximal speed is driven by bounded refinement and lightweight heuristics, but balancedness is moderate, suggesting under-correction by the limited k and swap budget. Increasing refine_steps/k or enabling more aggressive 2x2 exchanges could improve load balance at a minor speed trade-off.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent due to greedy packing and lightweight refinements, but balancedness is modest, likely limited by local heuristics and shallow swap depth (k≤2, ≤2 passes). Broader refinement or tuned diversity penalties may improve peak smoothing without large speed regressions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name adaptive_gpu_refine_and_second_heaviest_swap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a three-stage hierarchical policy: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, integer water-filling with a single donor→receiver fix-up for replication, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with one top-2 vs bottom-2 swap refinement; mapping inverses/scatters build the final indices, all on CPU tensors.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.311077, speed_score 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy passes and bounded refinements, but balancedness is moderate—single-step fix-ups and limited swaps likely leave load skew under high variance. The hierarchical placement preserves capacity and diversity constraints reliably, suggesting deeper or iterative refinements could further improve balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name top2_fixup_and_gpu_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with bounded refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with a k-candidate (k=2) heavy–light swap refiner, plus a diversity-aware variant that can consider second-light/heavy and optional 2x2 exchanges.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Forcing all tensors to CPU alters output device/dtype versus the expected API, likely causing failures. The hierarchical permutation/gather logic relies on strict divisibility assumptions and may misindex in edge cases, suggesting the need to preserve device, validate invariants, and robustly handle non-divisible configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name minimax_threshold_packer - Correct Program: False

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Program is correct and passes all validation tests; the approach maximizes speed while achieving moderate balance. The limited swap refinement (top-2 donors/receivers and few candidates) preserves speed but may cap balancedness compared to more exhaustive optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name moe_eplb_waterfill_diverse_seed - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical rebalance: groups are packed to nodes via a greedy balanced_packing with limited 1x1/2x2 swap refinement, experts are replicated per node using apportionment heuristics (D’Hondt bulk, Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail) plus a one-move fix-up, then replicas are packed to GPUs; deterministic tie-breaking is used throughout. All computations run on CPU tensors with permutation inversions built via scatter/gather to produce phy→log, log→phy, and counts.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The custom replication/packing heuristics and tie-breaking diverge from the expected EPLB behavior, producing incorrect mappings despite determinism and shape/device consistency. The apportionment-based replication and bounded swap refinements likely misalign with reference outputs, leading to systematic failures across test cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name moe_eplb_tail_ab_hill_swap3_tiebreak - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical Hybrid Expert Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Greedy sort-based balanced_packing enforces equal-count bins and performs bounded heaviest–lightest swap refinement with stable ranks. replicate_experts uses a CV-adaptive hybrid of D’Hondt (bulk) and Sainte-Laguë (tail) plus a local donor→receiver fix-up, embedded in a hierarchical group→node→GPU mapping, with CPU-friendly operations to minimize overhead.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.312, speed 1.00) across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: The approach attains maximal speed but only moderate balance; limited refinement steps and a single fix-up move constrain balancing quality. Modestly increasing refine_steps or strengthening the replication adjustment could improve balancedness with a small runtime trade-off; all validations passed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_2x2_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Greedy Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: groups are greedily packed to nodes with a small 2-item swap refinement; experts are replicated in-node using a hybrid allocator (bulk D’Hondt plus per-step Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill A/B with a post-fix move), then physical experts are packed to GPUs, using torch-based deterministic ops (inverse permutations, scatter) and a capacity==1 fast path. Deterministic tie-breakers ensure stable mappings across steps.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Heuristics (greedy pack + limited 2-way swaps and hybrid replication) maximize speed but leave measurable imbalance; broader refinement or larger candidate sets could improve balancedness. The hierarchical policy and deterministic design pass all checks and favor reproducibility and fast execution.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_cv - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diverse Packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: groups are LPT/ capacity-constrained packed to nodes, per-node replicas are assigned via water-filling with a peak-aware tail and up to two donor→receiver fixes, and GPU placement uses a diversity-aware heap with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps and a unique-label fast path. Produces physical↔logical mappings and ranks via tensor-based scatter/gather with exact per-pack capacities.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed comes from greedy tensor ops and tightly bounded refinements, but balancedness is moderate, likely limited by the small number of fix-up iterations and local swap scope. Consider deeper or adaptive refinement and broader swap candidates when residual imbalance remains high.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical packing (groups→nodes→GPUs) via greedy CPU assignment with deterministic tie-breaking and bounded k=2 best-swap refinement, plus a diversity-aware GPU packer. Replication uses a hybrid apportionment (bulk D’Hondt, per-row tail choice vs Sainte-Laguë) with a vectorized peak-minimizing fix-up; mappings are built via scatter/gather-based inverses.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validations; achieves excellent speed from lightweight greedy control flow and limited refinement. Balance quality is moderate, likely constrained by k=2 and small swap budgets; increasing k or refinement steps could improve balancedness at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_second_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid water-filling**
- **Implementation**: Uses binary-searched water-filling with a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë tail allocator and a small donor→receiver fix-up, then hierarchical packing (groups→nodes→GPUs) with diversity-aware heap placement and bounded 1x1/2x2 refinements; mappings are built via gather/scatter and inverse permutations. Fast paths (e.g., unique labels, cap=1) and CPU-friendly tensor ops keep it efficient.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent, but load balance is mediocre—likely due to greedy LPT/heap packing and the limited two-iteration fix-up not fully smoothing peaks. The unique-label fast path and bounded refinements help speed, yet more aggressive balancing or deeper refinements may improve the peak load.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill_and_peak_tiebreaks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB: hierarchical water-fill and diverse packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: groups are packed to nodes (greedy balanced_packing), logical experts are replicated via water-filling with a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë tail and a single donor→receiver fix-up, and intra-node GPU placement uses diversity-aware greedy packing with a bounded 1x1 swap refinement. Final mappings are built with vectorized scatter/gather for efficiency.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from bounded candidate sets, single-swap refinements, and vectorized operations; however, balancedness is only moderate, likely due to the conservative one-pass refinement steps. Allowing iterative or broader swap/refinement passes could improve balance at some cost to runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical waterfill and diverse-heap MoE balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: capacity-aware LPT to assign groups to nodes, per-node water-filling replica counts with a D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë hybrid tail and a small donor→receiver fix-up, then diversity-aware greedy GPU packing with a label-spreading seed and bounded 1x1/2x2 swap refinement. Uses Torch tensor ops (sort/topk/repeat_interleave/scatter) and fast paths for unique labels and unit capacities to keep it lean and deterministic.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the heuristics and fast paths are efficient, but the relatively low balancedness suggests the limited refinement (max two donor moves and shallow swap passes) leaves peak loads higher than optimal. Increasing refinement depth/iterations, stronger global swap searches, or more peak-aware tie-breaking during greedy placement could improve balance without severely impacting speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 75 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid apportionment EPLB with slack-spread packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical packing (groups→nodes via LPT-style balanced_packing), then per-node hybrid apportionment (bulk D’Hondt plus peak-aware Sainte–Laguë/D’Hondt tail) to assign replica counts, followed by slack-first label-spread GPU placement with capacity and anti-duplication plus a single bounded 1x1 peak-capping swap; builds contiguous physical-to-logical maps and ranks via vectorized PyTorch ops. This design ensures ≥1 replica per expert, maintains per-GPU capacity constraints, and minimizes peak load with low overhead.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306931, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from vectorized bulk apportionment and limiting to a single smoothing swap; balancedness is reasonable but leaves room for further peak reduction via additional or smarter local refinements. Robust handling of zero-weight and edge cases was observed, with stable hierarchical behavior across nodes/GPUs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 76 - Patch Name apportion_slack_spread_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical expert-parallel load balancer with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-stage EPLB: (1) greedy balanced_packing with bounded multi-swap refinement to place groups on nodes, (2) hybrid replication using D'Hondt bulk plus peak-aware Sainte-Laguë tail with a one-move fix-up, and (3) packing physical experts to GPUs. Uses Torch scatter/inverse permutation mappings and runs sorting/packing on CPU floats.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66: balancedness_score 0.311848 and speed_score 1.000000 across 5 workloads; all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Greedy packing with limited refinement and a single local replication fix-up maximizes speed but leaves noticeable imbalance. Raising refine_steps or allowing multiple improving moves per row could improve balancedness at some cost to speed; hierarchical mode assumes groups divide nodes, otherwise it falls back to a global policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a greedy, CPU-friendly balanced_packing with bounded heavy–light refinement; replicate_experts combines bulk D’Hondt allocation with a peak-aware Sainte–Laguë vs D’Hondt tail and a donor/receiver fix-up. A hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, and packs to GPUs with stable rank reassignment; weights are processed on CPU for speed.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all tests; excellent speed from greedy packing and limited refinement, but moderate balancedness indicates room for stronger refinement or fix-up to reduce peak load. The hierarchical policy likely improves locality while inheriting the core heuristic’s balancing limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 78 - Patch Name moe_eplb_peakaware_tail_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical mapping: balanced packing of groups to nodes, water-filling replica allocation with a small donor→receiver fix-up, then diversity-aware greedy GPU placement with label-spreading and bounded 1x1/2x2 refinement. Final maps are built via scatter/inverse permutations, keeping per-expert contiguous ranks and CPU-based tensor ops.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0 (fails all validation tests).
- **Feedback**: A critical bug in pack_diverse_heap references undefined variable num_items (should be n_items), causing a runtime failure. Beyond this, the approach depends on permutation assumptions in inverse/scatter and tight capacity arithmetic; add validations for per-pack capacity and index ranges to prevent subtle mapping errors.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 79 - Patch Name peakaware_fixup_and_diversity_guard - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diversity-Aware Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical balancing: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, per-node water-filling replica allocation with a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë tail and a bounded donor→receiver fix-up, then diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with label-spreading seed, label repeats penalty, and small 1x1/2x2 refinements. Efficient indexing via scatter/gather, repeat_interleave, and topk keeps operations CPU-friendly and avoids full sorts.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.63 (balancedness 0.2534, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent due to batched topk fills, fast unique-label path, and bounded refinements, but load balance is modest—likely limited by small candidate sets (top-3 x bottom-3), few refinement passes, and greedy capacity-constrained placements. The hybrid water-fill tail reduces peaks but doesn’t fully compensate for the constrained local search in packing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 80 - Patch Name moe_eplb_hybrid3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert-parallel balancer: greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with bounded 1x1 swap refinement and a 2x2 fallback, diversity-aware GPU packing, and replication via D’Hondt bulk plus Sainte–Laguë tail with peak/second-peak tie-breaking and a small peak-focused fix-up. Uses permutation inverses and gathers/scatters to maintain contiguous per-node layouts and maps between logical/meta/physical experts; initial greedy stages run on CPU for fast sorting.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The design favors speed via lightweight heuristics and limited refinement, passing all validations but yielding moderate balancedness. Increasing refinement steps or expanding swap search beyond top-2/bottom-2 could improve balance with minimal runtime impact.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 81 - Patch Name peak_aware_tail_balancer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill & Diverse-Heap EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Uses water-filling replication with an adaptive hybrid tail (D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë) and limited donor→receiver fix-ups; capacity-constrained LPT packing with 1x1/2x2 micro-swaps; and a diversity-aware heap GPU placement with label-aware tie-breaks, a unique-label fast path, and adaptive refinement depth. Follows a hierarchical pipeline (groups→nodes, replicate per node, pack to GPUs) and builds mappings via repeat_interleave/cumsum and scatter-based inverses.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Very fast due to lightweight heuristics and bounded refinements, but balancing is moderate—local 1x1/2x2 swaps and 1–3 refinement steps may under-optimize peak smoothing. Consider deeper or broader refinement (more candidates/steps or multi-pack swaps) and stronger label-duplication penalties to improve balancedness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 82 - Patch Name moe_eplb_hybrid_tail_peak_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Water-Filling + Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical policy: LPT-based balanced_packing assigns groups to nodes; water-filling replica allocation uses binary search with bulk D’Hondt plus an adaptive Sainte–Laguë tail and a small donor→receiver fix-up; GPU placement uses a diversity-aware heap with a unique-label fast path, label-spreading seed, greedy label-aware fill, and bounded 1x1/2x2 refinements. Efficient tensor gathers/scatters build contiguous phy↔log and rank maps with exact capacity enforcement.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Heuristics prioritize speed—limited fix-up iterations and shallow refinement keep runtime high (speed=1.0) but yield only moderate load balance; deeper donor/receiver search or more refinement passes could lift balancedness at some cost. Robust handling of edge cases (all-zero weights, unique labels) and strict capacity/count constraints is a strength.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 83 - Patch Name peak_aware_tail_and_fixup_tiebreaks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication and refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert load balancer: groups are greedily packed with bounded k-candidate 1x1 swaps (optional 2x2), replication uses a hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk then peak-aware choice among D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë/Huntington–Hill), and final GPU packing applies a diversity-aware tie-breaker with adaptive refinement. Control-flow heavy steps run on CPU with deterministic rank assignments and permutation utilities for stable mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.311077, speed_score 1.00) over 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the bounded refinement and CPU-centric loops are efficient, but moderate balancedness suggests conservative refinement settings (k=2, few steps, limited 2x2 in the default path) leave room for better load equalization. Increasing refine_steps or enabling adaptive/second-candidate options in the base packing could improve balancedness at a small cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 84 - Patch Name peak_aware_tail_and_adaptive_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-step balancer: groups-to-nodes packing (balanced_packing), hybrid expert replication (bulk D’Hondt, tail D’Hondt vs Sainte-Laguë with fix-ups), and GPU assignment via diversity-aware greedy packing with bounded best-swap refinement. Uses PyTorch gather/scatter and inverse permutations to maintain mappings on CPU.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0 (fails all validation tests).
- **Feedback**: balanced_packing is incomplete for groups_per_pack > 1 (no return), and the intended greedy+refinement logic is accidentally left as unreachable dead code after a return in _balanced_packing_diverse. These wiring errors break the group-to-node packing step; fixing balanced_packing and removing unreachable code should allow the otherwise reasonable algorithmic choices to be exercised.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 85 - Patch Name diverse_gpu_packing_and_two_move_fixup - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing and hybrid apportionment**
- **Implementation**: Greedy balanced packing with label-aware tie-breaks and adaptive 1x1/2x2 swap refinement; replication uses hybrid D’Hondt bulk plus peak-aware Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail with a conditional second fix-up, composed in a hierarchical groups→nodes→GPUs placement.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: The diversity-aware ties and bounded refinements keep runtime maximal but leave noticeable residual imbalance; increasing refinement depth/k or tuning thresholds (eps, swap passes) may improve balancedness. The hierarchical policy and vectorized apportionment provide determinism and scalability, but conservative CPU-side adjustments likely cap balance quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 86 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_diverse_gpu_tie_break - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Waterfill with Diverse GPU Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical pipeline: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, per-node water-filling replica allocation via threshold binary search with bulk D’Hondt and adaptive Sainte–Laguë tail plus up to two donor→receiver fix-ups, and a diversity-aware heap GPU placement with bounded 1x1/2x2 refinements. Uses CPU torch ops with sort/topk, gather/scatter-based inverses, and builds contiguous block mappings for replicas and ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from vectorized topk and tightly bounded refinement loops, but balancedness is modest due to greedy packing and limited post-optimization. Deeper or broader refinements could improve balance at the cost of runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 87 - Patch Name hybrid_waterfill_peakaware_tail_and_diverse_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Adaptive Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical expert load balancing: greedy lightest-bin packing with deterministic ranks and bounded refinement (best 1x1 swap via searchsorted plus a 2x2 fallback), a diversity-aware variant for GPU placement, and a hybrid replication allocator (bulk D’Hondt; tail chooses among Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill/D’Hondt to minimize predicted peak) with a small fix-up. Uses stable tie-breaking, row-wise inverse permutations, and maps groups→nodes→GPUs under capacity constraints with vectorized PyTorch operations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validations; runtime is excellent due to greedy placement and limited local refinements. Balancedness is modest, likely limited by small refine_steps and local swaps; deeper refinement or larger multi-item exchanges may improve balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 88 - Patch Name peak_aware_tail_and_2x2_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Equal-Proportions and Peak-Aware Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical steps: LPT group-to-node packing with a single bounded 1x1 swap; Equal-Proportions (Huntington–Hill) replication with up to two donor→receiver fixes; and GPU packing via peak-aware, diversity-tied greedy assignment limited to the top-2 candidate packs, plus bounded 1x1 swap (and 2x2 fallback) with adaptive refinement depth. Employs exact capacities, inverse permutations, and scatter/gather to construct physical↔logical maps efficiently.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.289431, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The restricted candidate set and bounded refinements deliver excellent speed, but balancedness is modest, indicating residual peak skew likely from limited fix-ups and early stopping. The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Hybrid replication with D’Hondt bulk plus Sainte–Laguë tail and a single guarded donor→receiver fix-up consistently yields the top balancedness at perfect speed.
  - Current best program (Hierarchical EPLB code shown; balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00, combined 0.66) uses exactly this allocator: D’Hondt for bulk, Sainte–Laguë tail, then a one-step peak-reducing fix-up based on top-2 peak analysis.
  - Matching top performers include:
    - Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing and hybrid apportionment (Gen86, balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00, combined 0.66)
    - Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Adaptive Replication (Gen88, 0.311848, 1.00, 0.66)
- Bounded heaviest↔lightest 1x1 swap refinement after greedy, capacity-constrained packing improves peak smoothing with negligible overhead.
  - The current best uses refine_steps=1 at the group→node layer and refine_steps=2 at the GPU layer; similar settings appear in Gen86 and Gen88 (all at 0.311848, speed 1.00).
  - Searchsorted-based selection to minimize the post-swap delta (as in the best program’s CapacityPacker._refine_single_layer) is effective without expanding search breadth.
- Deterministic hierarchical pipeline with CPU-friendly tensor ops preserves speed and correctness.
  - Groups→nodes via balanced_packing, replicate within nodes, then pack to GPUs; stable mappings via PermOps.inverse and gather/scatter.
  - All top programs maintain speed 1.00 and pass validations while achieving the best balancedness (e.g., Gen86, Gen88, current best).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Water-filling-centric replication underperforms the hybrid tail and can degrade significantly when paired with constrained local search.
  - Multiple variants trail by ~0.0007–0.0008 balancedness at the same speed:
    - Hierarchical Water-Fill & Diverse-Heap EPLB (Gen82, 0.311077, 1.00, 0.66)
    - Water-Filling + Diverse Packing EPLB (Gen83, ~0.3111, 1.00, 0.66)
    - Hierarchical Waterfill with Diverse GPU Packing EPLB (Gen87, ~0.3111, 1.00, 0.66)
  - A more restrictive variant suffered a large drop:
    - Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diversity-Aware Packing (Gen80, 0.2534, 1.00, 0.63), attributed to small candidate sets (top-3 × bottom-3), few refinement passes, and greedy placements that limit local search effectiveness.
- Equal-Proportions-only (Huntington–Hill) replication lags the hybrid tail.
  - Hierarchical EPLB with Equal-Proportions and Peak-Aware Packing (Gen89) achieved 0.289431 balancedness (speed 1.00, combined 0.64), notably below the 0.311848 cluster.
- Implementation wiring mistakes nullify otherwise sound designs.
  - Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication (Gen85) fails all validations (combined 0.0) due to an incomplete balanced_packing path (no return for groups_per_pack > 1) and unreachable dead code, highlighting the fragility of control flow in packing routines.

## Implementation Insights
- Why the current best program is effective:
  - Replication allocator:
    - D’Hondt bulk (benefit = weight / r) plus Sainte–Laguë tail (weight / (2r-1)) balances proportionality and peak control.
    - A single donor→receiver fix-up triggers only on strict global peak reduction computed via top-2 average load comparison; it relocates the donor’s highest-rank replica to the receiver and updates counts in O(row) time.
  - Packing and refinement:
    - Greedy capacity-constrained assignment to the lightest pack establishes a strong baseline.
    - Searchsorted-based best 1x1 swap between the heaviest and lightest packs reduces the max-load gap (delta) and updates pack loads incrementally; deterministic ranks within packs stabilize mapping.
  - Hierarchical mapping and CPU-friendly ops:
    - Contiguous meta-logical layouts via log2mlog and its inverse, with gather/scatter to build physical mappings.
    - Fast paths (e.g., capacity==1) and small per-row loops keep control-flow on CPU efficient; vectorized torch ops (argsort, topk, scatter_add_) maintain speed and correctness.
- Concrete patterns across programs:
  - The hybrid-tail replication plus bounded swap refinement pattern correlates with the top balancedness cluster (current best, Gen86, Gen88).
  - Diversity-aware GPU ties appear in several top performers (e.g., Gen86), but the current best achieves the top score without explicit label-aware ties, indicating replication and swap refinement dominate balancedness under these workloads.

## Performance Analysis
- Best-in-class results:
  - Balancedness 0.311848 with speed 1.00 (combined 0.66) is achieved by the current best program and others using the same hybrid replication + bounded swap refinement template (Gen86, Gen88). All pass validations.
- Water-filling cluster:
  - Programs with water-filling replication consistently score ~0.311–0.3111 balancedness at speed 1.00 (Gen82, Gen83, Gen87), lagging the hybrid-tail leaders by ~0.0007–0.0008.
  - A constrained-search water-filling variant performed much worse (Gen80 at 0.2534, combined 0.63), reinforcing that overly restricted candidate sets and shallow refinement can materially harm balance.
- Alternative apportionment:
  - Huntington–Hill as the primary allocator (Gen89) reached 0.289431 balancedness at speed 1.00 (combined 0.64), outperforming the worst water-fill variant but trailing the hybrid-tail leaders by a clear margin.
- Correctness and speed:
  - All passing programs maintain speed 1.00; balancedness is the differentiator.
  - Implementation correctness is binary: Gen85’s wiring errors resulted in a combined score of 0.0 despite otherwise reasonable algorithmic choices.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Make the hybrid tail adaptive per row and per step with a peak-aware chooser. Keep the current D’Hondt bulk, but for the last T allocations in each row compute both the D’Hondt and Sainte–Laguë winners, simulate the post-pick averages, and choose the one minimizing (new_peak, new_second_peak, receiver_count). Set T row-wise as T = max(1, round(0.1 · num_redundant_row · clamp((cur_max/mean(avg) − 1), 0, 1))), and implement this inside replicate_experts by vectorizing the two-candidate evaluation to preserve speed.

2. Expand the guarded replication fix-up to up to 2 moves with a tiny, peak-focused candidate set. For each row, form donors from the top-2 experts by current average and receivers from the bottom-2, evaluate all donor→receiver moves, and apply the one that strictly reduces (new_peak, new_second_peak, post-move donor_avg) lexicographically; then recompute and optionally repeat once. Continue to pick the donor’s highest-rank physical column for the move to keep O(row) time and determinism.

3. Add a bounded 2x2 fallback swap in CapacityPacker._refine_single_layer when the 1x1 swap stalls. If the searchsorted 1x1 swap provides no strict delta reduction, evaluate at most four pairings between the top-2 heavy-pack items and top-2 light-pack items, committing only if it reduces the max pack load; update pack_w incrementally. Enable this at both layers (groups→nodes with refine_steps=1 and GPUs with refine_steps=2) without increasing refine_steps counts.

4. Introduce diversity-aware tie-breaking in GPU packing to avoid replica co-location. Extend balanced_packing to accept optional item labels (logical expert ids) and maintain a tiny per-pack label counter; on equal-load ties during greedy placement, select the pack where the label count is minimal (prefer unseen), otherwise choose the lightest pack as usual. Apply this only at the GPU layer to preserve the proven lightest-pack heuristic and determinism.

5. Make refinement steps adaptive to residual imbalance with early-exit guards. After greedy packing, compute delta_ratio = (max(pack_w) − min(pack_w)) / mean(pack_w); if delta_ratio > 0.02 at the GPU layer, allow one extra refinement iteration (effective refine_steps=3) for that row only; similarly, if the groups→nodes delta_ratio > 0.03, permit a single extra refinement iteration there. Keep the existing 1x1-first policy, stop as soon as no strict delta reduction is achieved, and retain the fast path when imbalance is already small.
