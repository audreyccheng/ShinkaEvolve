# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer for vLLM**
- **Implementation**: Implements a greedy, hierarchical rearrangement using PyTorch: groups are packed to nodes, experts replicated within nodes, and physical experts packed to GPUs via a balanced_packing heuristic, with permutations managed by scatter/gather and an inverse mapping. Computation is performed primarily on CPU (weight.float().cpu()) with per-layer greedy choices and fixed replica counts used to build phy→log, log→phy, and expert count maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy packing and CPU-based tensor ops, but yields only moderate load balance. Hierarchical constraints and per-layer greedy decisions (e.g., weight/logcnt replication and group-first packing) likely limit balancedness compared to more global or optimal assignments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical strategy: groups→nodes via balanced packing, per-node “water-filling” replication, and diversity-aware greedy assignment of replicas to GPUs that minimizes label collocation while equalizing per-pack load; permutation inverses and scatter build physical↔logical maps. Trivial/fast paths (e.g., one item per pack, no-duplicate labels) and CPU-friendly loops via list conversions keep overhead low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The diversity-aware step reduces hotspotting of identical labels, but the equal-items-per-pack constraint and greedy choices yield only moderate load balance. Efficient early exits and lightweight loops drive the top speed score.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name diversity_aware_gpu_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy sort-based bin packing per layer with a small local 2-opt-style refinement between heaviest/lightest packs. Replication is selected via argmax(weight/logcnt) within nodes, then replicas are packed to GPUs; final mappings are built via gather/scatter and inverse permutations, operating on CPU tensors for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306805, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed shows the greedy + limited refinement is lightweight, but moderate balancedness indicates room for stronger global balancing. More refinement iterations or smarter swap selection could improve balance; hierarchical policy is used when groups align with nodes, otherwise a global fallback is applied.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name local_swap_refine_in_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Serpentine Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses vectorized serpentine (snake) packing per layer to evenly assign sorted experts to packs, and a d'Hondt-like greedy replicator that allocates extra replicas by weight/count. A hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs using amortized loads, implemented with PyTorch scatter/gather and permutation inverses (with a fast path when groups_per_pack==1).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.63 (balancedness 0.254285, speed 1.00; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Fully vectorized design achieves maximal speed but modest balancedness, suggesting the greedy replication plus snake packing underperform under skewed loads. Correctness is solid (passes all tests); balancedness may improve with local swap/refinement or more global optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name eplb_snake_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Diversity-Aware Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical three-stage pipeline: (1) greedy group-to-node packing with up to 4 heaviest/lightest swaps, (2) per-node expert replication via an incremental ratio (weight/count) greedy update, and (3) GPU placement with diversity-aware packing that prioritizes label spread then projected load. Mapping inverses and placements are built via scatter/gather for efficiency, with selective CPU sorting and minimal refinement to keep runtime low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.3068, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests. It prioritizes speed—greedy choices and limited local refinement yield maximal runtime performance but only moderate balance; diversity-aware packing helps reduce hotspotting, though the capped refinements likely limit balancedness gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name diverse_pack_projload_and_incremental_ratio - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical strategy: groups are packed to nodes via balanced_packing, logical experts are replicated with Hamilton’s method (largest remainder) in replicate_experts, and physical experts are assigned to GPUs using a diversity-aware greedy packer that spreads identical labels to reduce hotspotting. Mappings are built with vectorized torch ops (scatter/inverse), and the top-level casts weights to CPU for consistent, fast execution.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.2897, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy policies and vectorized construction of mappings, but balancedness is modest, indicating the greedy packing and proportional replication may under-serve heavy experts or miss global optimality. Consider stronger global balancing heuristics or improved tie-breaking beyond label diversity to raise balancedness without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name proportional_quota_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs logical expert groups to nodes, greedily replicates experts within nodes, then balances physical experts across GPUs. The core balanced_packing uses per-layer greedy assignment with fixed per-pack item counts and a lightweight single-swap refinement; replicate_experts greedily allocates by current load (weight/logcnt), and mappings are built via scatter/gather operations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy passes and minimal refinement, but achieves only moderate balance. Single-swap local improvement and equal-cardinality packing likely cap balancedness; nevertheless, the solution is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name single_swap_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and D’Hondt Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer (sort-by-weight, place into lightest pack) with a single heaviest↔lightest swap refinement and deterministic in-pack ranks; replica allocation is a vectorized D’Hondt-style water-filling. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes and GPUs via permutation ops (including a scatter-based inverse), with replication done per node and final mappings produced by gather/scatter.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The lightweight greedy packing favors speed but leaves noticeable imbalance; increasing refinement steps or applying smarter swap/refinement strategies could raise balancedness with modest cost. Vectorized allocation and permutation-based layout keep the approach simple and fast, and all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name moe_eplb_modular_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer greedy balanced_packing (descending sort with capacity-constrained assignment) plus up to two bounded heavy-light swaps to reduce imbalance while reassigning ranks. Applies a hierarchical strategy: pack groups to nodes, greedily replicate experts via weight/logcnt, then pack physical experts to GPUs; mappings are constructed via gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed from lightweight greedy steps and limited refinement, but modest balancedness suggests under-optimization of load distribution. More aggressive or global refinement could improve balance at the expense of speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name multi_swap_refinement_balanced_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: RR-WF Packing with Hare Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements Round-Robin Waterfilling packing to assign items to packs in capacity rounds, with a lightweight post-swap refinement; uses Hare (Hamilton) largest-remainder to allocate replicas proportionally, then a hierarchical pipeline (group→node packing, intra-node replication, GPU packing) built with vectorized torch gathers/scatters and an inverse-permutation utility. The entry rebalance forces weight to float().cpu() and selects hierarchical when groups % nodes == 0, otherwise a global fallback.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.289706, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple per-round vectorized ops, stable sorting, and minimal refinement; per-row loops (remainders/topk, final swap) are lightweight. Balance is improved over naive strategies but remains moderate, suggesting headroom beyond the single-pass RR-WF plus optional one-swap refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name rr_waterfill_hare - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill + Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical balancer: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, intra-node water-filling replica allocation via binary search with greedy extras, and GPU placement using a diversity-aware heap that minimizes (label repeats, load, fill). It builds contiguous phy2log/rank with repeat_interleave, inverts mappings where needed, and scatters logical→physical indices; falls back to a single-node policy when groups aren’t node-aligned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000) across 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU sorts, vectorized gathers/scatters, and simple greedy heuristics, but achieves only moderate balance. Balancedness likely suffers from the greedy capacity-constrained packers and per-node isolation; tuning the packing objective or more global optimization could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name waterfill_diverse_heap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diverse Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical packing of logical experts to nodes and GPUs: greedy capacity-constrained packing with K=2 heavy–light swaps, diversity-aware packing to spread identical labels, and a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replication strategy. Uses vectorized gathers/scatters and invert-permutation helpers to build physical↔logical maps and replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.304918, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: All tests passed; packing and replication are fast, yielding top speed but only moderate balance. The limited K=2 refinement and local (per-node) swaps likely cap balancedness despite diversity-aware placement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: packs expert groups to nodes with capacity-aware LPT, performs per-node water-filling replication with a one-step donor→receiver fix, then assigns to GPUs via a diversity-aware heap plus a k=2 swap refinement. Builds physical→logical and logical→physical maps via scatter/gather with contiguous replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent, indicating low overhead from the greedy/heap steps and CPU tensor ops. Balancedness is modest, suggesting the single-step fix and limited 2-opt swap cap equalization, leaving room for deeper refinement if needed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert-parallel balancer: groups are greedily packed to nodes with a bounded multi-swap refinement (max_swaps=2), replicas are allocated per layer via a D’Hondt-like scheme with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, and physical experts are then packed to GPUs; mappings use gather/scatter with inverse permutations for determinism. Packing operates on CPU tensors with stable rank reassignment to maintain per-pack ordering.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy heuristics and tightly bounded refinement, but balancedness is moderate, likely limited by the two-swap bound and single-step replica fix-up. Hierarchical placement benefits topology-aware locality when groups are node-divisible; otherwise it falls back to a global policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name replication_fixup_one_step - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer sorted greedy balanced_packing with exact items-per-pack and a bounded (max 2) multi-swap refinement to reduce imbalance. Replication applies a D’Hondt-like greedy allocation plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs with inverse maps and stable ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed but moderate balancedness, likely limited by the small swap budget and single-step replication correction. The hierarchical policy preserves locality and determinism; increasing refinement steps could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name one_step_replication_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB Hybrid Hierarchical Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical expert balancing with a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replica apportionment (plus a one-step fix-up), greedy capacity-constrained packing with k=2 best-improvement swaps, and a diversity-aware GPU assignment tie-breaker. Uses permutation inversion utilities and staged refinement (1 step for groups→nodes, 2 steps for physical→GPU packing).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The replica fix-up moves a seat from the highest-average “donor” to the lowest-average “receiver,” which worsens imbalance (direction should be receiver→donor), likely breaking correctness. Additionally, layout reshaping/gather assumes block-contiguous permutations and the forced .cpu() cast may violate expected device semantics, contributing to failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name hydra_k2_diversity_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses capacity-constrained greedy packing over sorted weights with bounded multi-swap refinement; hierarchical grouping packs groups→nodes and replicas→GPUs via inverse-permutation mappings. Replication applies a D’Hondt allocation with a Sainte-Laguë tail and a single donor→receiver fix-up, with deterministic rank reassignment.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65; balancedness_score 0.304918, speed_score 1.000000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: The limited refinement (refine_steps=1–2) and one-step fix-up prioritize speed but leave noticeable imbalance. Increasing swap iterations or applying richer local search could improve balancedness at some runtime cost; all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallel Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: packs expert groups to nodes via greedy balanced_packing with bounded multi-swap refinement, replicates experts using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) allocator plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, then packs physical replicas to GPUs. Uses CPU-based sorting/scatter and stable rank reassignment, with inverse mappings for logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the greedy, bounded-swap design and CPU-side ops keep overhead low. Balancedness is moderate, likely constrained by the single-step replica fix-up and small refine_steps; allowing more refinement or multi-move adjustments could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_specific_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diversity-Aware EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Performs hierarchical load balancing: packs expert groups to nodes with greedy balanced packing, replicates experts per node by max normalized load, then assigns replicas to GPUs using diversity-aware greedy packing with a single k=2 best-improvement swap; mappings use vectorized gather/scatter for efficiency. Includes a fast path when labels are unique and tie-breakers to reduce label duplication per pack.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; the diversity-aware greedy plus minimal refinement achieves excellent speed but only moderate balance. More aggressive refinement (multi-swap or iterative improvement) could raise balancedness, though current design already reduces hotspotting from replica co-location.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name k2_micro_swap_diverse - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and hybrid apportionment**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs groups to nodes, replicates experts within nodes using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a one-step fix-up, then assigns physical experts to GPUs via balanced packing. The packing is a sorted greedy placement with capacity constraints plus bounded local multi-swap refinement; mappings are constructed with gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validation tests. Excellent speed due to bounded refinement and lightweight apportionment, while moderate balancedness indicates potential gains from higher refine_steps or multi-iteration replication adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name refine_packing_and_hybrid_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- Implementation: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with per-layer targeted heavy-light swaps (searchsorted-based) determines group/node/GPU placement; a hierarchical layout uses permutation inverses to keep groups contiguous and then packs per-GPU experts after replication. Replication employs hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; deterministic intra-pack ranks and vectorized torch ops are used throughout.
- Performance: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000, 5 workloads).
- Feedback: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; limited refinement steps and the single-step replication fix-up likely cap balancedness. Increasing refine_steps or enabling multi-swap/multi-move adjustments could improve balance at some cost in speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name moe_eplb_crossover_capacityperm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical staging: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, water-filling replication per node with a top-2 donor/bottom-2 receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a k=2 swap refinement. Physical↔logical maps and ranks are built via repeat_interleave and scatter/gather with exact per-pack capacities.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and fast, but balancedness is only moderate, suggesting the greedy packing and limited local refinements reduce peaks but don’t fully equalize load. Stronger global adjustments could further improve balance without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name top2_replica_fix_and_tieaware_pack - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and quota replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps and an adaptive second swap; replication allocates via a D’Hondt bulk phase followed by per-row Sainte-Laguë vs Huntington–Hill selection and a single-move donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical policy packs groups to nodes and physical experts to GPUs, with fast permutation inverses and scatter-based map construction and deterministic in-pack ranking.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306257, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Minimal refinement and simple scans preserve peak speed but cap balance quality; adaptive tail sizing (via coefficient of variation) and hierarchical staging improve robustness. The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name eplb_k2swap_hybrid_apportion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a bounded k=2 heaviest-lightest swap refinement, combined with hierarchical node/group/GPU placement. Replication uses a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a single best-improving donor→receiver fix-up to reduce peak average load.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The algorithm is very fast due to greedy packing and limited local refinement, but balancedness is modest, suggesting the k=2 swap and single fix-up move under-correct skew. Increasing refine_steps, considering larger swap candidate sets, or multiple fix-up iterations could improve balance at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name adaptive_refine_and_replication_fixup_k2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with k-swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-stage balancer: groups-to-nodes via greedy packing plus bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, intra-node expert replication using apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail) with a one-move fix-up, then GPU packing with a diversity-aware tie-break; deterministic ranking and inverse-permutation utilities included. Core loops run on CPU for control flow, with small-k refinement and optional adaptive second swap for improved local balance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Achieves maximal speed due to lightweight CPU-driven greedy packing and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest. Increasing refine_steps/k, strengthening swap search, or more aggressive diversity penalties could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name dhh_diverse_k2_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB: Hierarchical Hybrid Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a CPU-friendly greedy balanced_packing with per-layer sort, capacity-aware assignment, and bounded heaviest-lightest refinement swaps; replicate_experts applies a hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical rebalancing packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs replicas to GPUs, with permutation inverses and rank-aware log2phy scatter for final maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy CPU paths and limited refinement, while balancedness is modest likely due to small refine_steps and single-step replication fix-up. The hierarchical policy favors locality and stability but may under-balance globally in some distributions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name moe_eplb_hybrid_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Staged pipeline: GroupPacker does LPT-style greedy packing with a bounded k=2 best-improvement swap; ReplicaAllocator apportions replicas via D’Hondt bulk then A/B between Sainte-Laguë and Huntington–Hill with a single donor→receiver correction; GpuPlacer uses greedy projected-load assignment with a diversity-aware tie-breaker and adaptive k=2 refinement. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes, allocates within nodes, then places to GPUs, with a global fallback when grouping doesn’t align with nodes.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.299, speed 1.000) over 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Perfect speed shows the heuristics are lightweight and implementation efficient, while modest balancedness suggests the greedy choices and single bounded swaps leave residual imbalance. The apportionment tail improves peak per-replica averages and the diversity tie-breaker helps spread replicas, but limited refinement likely caps balancing quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name eplb_pipeline_apportion_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical 3-step pipeline: capacity-aware LPT packing of groups to nodes, per-(layer,node) water-filling replication with a small donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with a unique-label fast path and a single 2-opt swap; mappings are built via vectorized torch gather/scatter with contiguous ranks per expert. Assumes exact per-pack capacity and enforces at least one replica per logical expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is fast due to simple sorts, limited local refinements, and lightweight CPU tensor ops, but balancedness is modest, likely bounded by the greedy packing and shallow (k≤2) fix-ups. Deeper refinement or broader swap searches could improve balance at a small runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name moe_eplb_waterfill_diverse_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with zig-zag packing and water-filling**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical balancer: groups are stripe-packed (zig-zag) to nodes, experts replicated in-node via water-filling (binary search + greedy rounding), and replicas stripe-packed to GPUs using per-replica average load; mappings are built with scatter/gather and permutation inverses for deterministic phy2log/log2phy. Runs on CPU tensors, enforces exact per-pack capacity, and ignores refine_steps in packing for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.310534, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads; all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; the single-pass stripe packing and batched rounding in water-filling (full-round increments before top-k) likely cap balance quality. Iterative refinement or stricter marginal-benefit allocation for remaining replicas could improve balancedness without large runtime penalties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name waterfill_stripe_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with K-swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, plus a diversity-aware tie-break for near-ties. Hierarchical pipeline: pack groups to nodes, replicate via vectorized minimax with a one-move fix-up, then pack replicas to GPUs; outputs deterministic ranks and mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.308909, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed comes from lightweight CPU control flow and vectorized allocation steps, but the small k and swap budget bias toward speed over balance, resulting in modest balancedness. Increasing refine_steps/k or strengthening the post-allocation fix-up could improve balance; the very small diversity penalty likely has limited impact.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name moe_eplb_minimax_replicator - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication and k-candidate refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing with fixed pack sizes and a bounded k=2 swap refinement to reduce per-pack imbalance, while maintaining stable in-pack ranks. Replication is allocated via a hybrid apportionment (D'Hondt bulk, Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a single best donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline maps groups→nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs, using gather/scatter inversion for mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement (k=2, max 2 swaps) and single-move fix-up keep it very fast but limit final balance quality. Increasing swap candidates/iterations or allowing multi-move adjustments could improve balancedness at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name k2_refine_and_stronger_replication_fix - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Waterfill and Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Uses water-filling replica allocation (binary search + greedy extras) with a small donor→receiver fix-up, hierarchical group-to-node LPT-like packing, and diversity-aware heap GPU placement with label-aware tie-breaking plus bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps; mappings are composed via gather/scatter with inverse permutations. Optimized fast paths exist for trivial capacities and unique labels, and ranks are kept contiguous per expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU tensor ops, constrained candidate sets, and early-exit paths, but achieves only moderate balance. Limited refinement depth (k=2 swaps, two fix-up iterations) and greedy packing likely leave headroom for improved peak smoothing, though the solution is correct and passes all validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name light2_and_pair_swap_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB with Diverse GPU Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical placement: group-to-node balanced packing (capacity-aware LPT), per-node water-filling replica allocation with a donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a bounded 1x1 swap refinement. Mapping is built via vectorized gather/scatter with contiguous replica ranks and robust edge-case handling (e.g., capacity=1, all-zero weights).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66; balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; excellent speed from greedy heuristics and minimal refinement. Balancedness is modest, likely limited by the single-step donor/receiver tweak and bounded 1x1 swap, indicating potential gains from deeper or iterative refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name replicate_fixup_and_light2_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical 3-stage balancer: groups→nodes via greedy packing with 1-step k×k refinement, intra-node replication using a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte-Laguë (tail selected by simulation) plus a capped 2-move fix-up, and GPU placement via diversity-aware packing with adaptive depth and optional 2×2 swaps. Deterministic ranks and inverse permutations ensure stable layouts; control-flow heavy parts run on CPU.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00) over 5 workloads; passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong speed stems from bounded k=2 candidate swaps and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest, likely due to 1-step refinement in group packing and disabled 2×2/second-light in the base pass. Increasing refine_steps or enabling broader light-pack candidates/2×2 in balanced_packing should improve balance with minimal impact on speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name moe_eplb_dualrefine_tailabc - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Diversity-aware hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical packing (groups→nodes, replicate within nodes, then pack to GPUs) with water-filling-based replication plus a donor→receiver fix-up, and a diversity-aware balanced packing that spreads identical labels and applies a single 1x1 swap refinement between heavy/light packs. Provides invertible mappings and ranks, with a CPU float normalization at the entry point for consistency.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.3111, speed_score 1.0; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy assignment and bounded refinement. Balancedness is moderate; the one-swap refinement and local greedy choices improve hotspots but leave headroom for further imbalance reduction. The program is correct and passed all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name waterfill_and_light_pair_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a targeted heaviest↔lightest swap (searchsorted-based) refinement; fast-path for capacity==1. Employs a hierarchical policy (groups→nodes), hybrid D’Hondt then Sainte-Laguë replication with a local fix-up move, and diversity-aware GPU packing with label-based tie-breaking and adaptive refinement; permutation inverses and scatters map between logical/meta/global IDs.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Lightweight refinement and greedy heuristics keep runtime excellent but leave balance suboptimal; increasing refinement steps or broader swap neighborhoods could improve balancedness. CPU staging in the diversity-aware step and Python loops did not impact this benchmark’s speed but may be a scalability consideration for larger inputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name eplb_hybrid_diverse_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Waterfill-Based Hierarchical vLLM Expert Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical placement: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, water-filling replica allocation with guarded donor→receiver fix-ups (up to two moves), and diversity-aware heap-based GPU packing with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps and adaptive refinement; builds physical↔logical maps via tensor gather/scatter with exact per-pack capacities and contiguous replica ranks. 
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement and capped fix-ups prioritize speed but limit balancedness improvements, leaving residual peak load after water-filling. Diversity-aware packing improves label spread, yet the conservative swap policy may under-optimize the global max load across GPUs.

Exact pack capacities are enforced, with permutation inverses used to map between logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.0 and failed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Results likely violate the expected output contract (e.g., forcing tensors to CPU in rebalance_experts, potential permutation/device mismatches), causing correctness failures. Preserve input device for outputs, verify permutation assumptions for inverse mappings, and ensure the hierarchical remapping and refinement steps produce bitwise-identical outputs to prior versions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name interleaved_zigzag_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: EPLB hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing per layer with bounded 1x1 and 2x2 swap refinement, and a hybrid replication scheme (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a small tail auto-tuning and per-row fix-up.

Control-flow-heavy steps run on CPU, with adaptive refinement depth based on imbalance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.309358, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Maximal speed is driven by bounded refinement and lightweight heuristics, but balancedness is moderate, suggesting under-correction by the limited k and swap budget. Increasing refine_steps/k or enabling more aggressive 2x2 exchanges could improve load balance at a minor speed trade-off.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent due to greedy packing and lightweight refinements, but balancedness is modest, likely limited by local heuristics and shallow swap depth (k≤2, ≤2 passes). Broader refinement or tuned diversity penalties may improve peak smoothing without large speed regressions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name adaptive_gpu_refine_and_second_heaviest_swap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a three-stage hierarchical policy: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, integer water-filling with a single donor→receiver fix-up for replication, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with one top-2 vs bottom-2 swap refinement; mapping inverses/scatters build the final indices, all on CPU tensors.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.311077, speed_score 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy passes and bounded refinements, but balancedness is moderate—single-step fix-ups and limited swaps likely leave load skew under high variance. The hierarchical placement preserves capacity and diversity constraints reliably, suggesting deeper or iterative refinements could further improve balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name top2_fixup_and_gpu_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with bounded refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with a k-candidate (k=2) heavy–light swap refiner, plus a diversity-aware variant that can consider second-light/heavy and optional 2x2 exchanges.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Forcing all tensors to CPU alters output device/dtype versus the expected API, likely causing failures. The hierarchical permutation/gather logic relies on strict divisibility assumptions and may misindex in edge cases, suggesting the need to preserve device, validate invariants, and robustly handle non-divisible configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name minimax_threshold_packer - Correct Program: False

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Program is correct and passes all validation tests; the approach maximizes speed while achieving moderate balance. The limited swap refinement (top-2 donors/receivers and few candidates) preserves speed but may cap balancedness compared to more exhaustive optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name moe_eplb_waterfill_diverse_seed - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical rebalance: groups are packed to nodes via a greedy balanced_packing with limited 1x1/2x2 swap refinement, experts are replicated per node using apportionment heuristics (D’Hondt bulk, Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail) plus a one-move fix-up, then replicas are packed to GPUs; deterministic tie-breaking is used throughout. All computations run on CPU tensors with permutation inversions built via scatter/gather to produce phy→log, log→phy, and counts.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The custom replication/packing heuristics and tie-breaking diverge from the expected EPLB behavior, producing incorrect mappings despite determinism and shape/device consistency. The apportionment-based replication and bounded swap refinements likely misalign with reference outputs, leading to systematic failures across test cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name moe_eplb_tail_ab_hill_swap3_tiebreak - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical Hybrid Expert Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Greedy sort-based balanced_packing enforces equal-count bins and performs bounded heaviest–lightest swap refinement with stable ranks. replicate_experts uses a CV-adaptive hybrid of D’Hondt (bulk) and Sainte-Laguë (tail) plus a local donor→receiver fix-up, embedded in a hierarchical group→node→GPU mapping, with CPU-friendly operations to minimize overhead.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.312, speed 1.00) across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: The approach attains maximal speed but only moderate balance; limited refinement steps and a single fix-up move constrain balancing quality. Modestly increasing refine_steps or strengthening the replication adjustment could improve balancedness with a small runtime trade-off; all validations passed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_2x2_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Greedy Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: groups are greedily packed to nodes with a small 2-item swap refinement; experts are replicated in-node using a hybrid allocator (bulk D’Hondt plus per-step Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill A/B with a post-fix move), then physical experts are packed to GPUs, using torch-based deterministic ops (inverse permutations, scatter) and a capacity==1 fast path. Deterministic tie-breakers ensure stable mappings across steps.
- **Performance**: Achieved combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Heuristics (greedy pack + limited 2-way swaps and hybrid replication) maximize speed but leave measurable imbalance; broader refinement or larger candidate sets could improve balancedness. The hierarchical policy and deterministic design pass all checks and favor reproducibility and fast execution.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_cv - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diverse Packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: groups are LPT/ capacity-constrained packed to nodes, per-node replicas are assigned via water-filling with a peak-aware tail and up to two donor→receiver fixes, and GPU placement uses a diversity-aware heap with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps and a unique-label fast path. Produces physical↔logical mappings and ranks via tensor-based scatter/gather with exact per-pack capacities.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed comes from greedy tensor ops and tightly bounded refinements, but balancedness is moderate, likely limited by the small number of fix-up iterations and local swap scope. Consider deeper or adaptive refinement and broader swap candidates when residual imbalance remains high.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical packing (groups→nodes→GPUs) via greedy CPU assignment with deterministic tie-breaking and bounded k=2 best-swap refinement, plus a diversity-aware GPU packer. Replication uses a hybrid apportionment (bulk D’Hondt, per-row tail choice vs Sainte-Laguë) with a vectorized peak-minimizing fix-up; mappings are built via scatter/gather-based inverses.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validations; achieves excellent speed from lightweight greedy control flow and limited refinement. Balance quality is moderate, likely constrained by k=2 and small swap budgets; increasing k or refinement steps could improve balancedness at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_second_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid water-filling**
- **Implementation**: Uses binary-searched water-filling with a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë tail allocator and a small donor→receiver fix-up, then hierarchical packing (groups→nodes→GPUs) with diversity-aware heap placement and bounded 1x1/2x2 refinements; mappings are built via gather/scatter and inverse permutations. Fast paths (e.g., unique labels, cap=1) and CPU-friendly tensor ops keep it efficient.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent, but load balance is mediocre—likely due to greedy LPT/heap packing and the limited two-iteration fix-up not fully smoothing peaks. The unique-label fast path and bounded refinements help speed, yet more aggressive balancing or deeper refinements may improve the peak load.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill_and_peak_tiebreaks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB: hierarchical water-fill and diverse packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: groups are packed to nodes (greedy balanced_packing), logical experts are replicated via water-filling with a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë tail and a single donor→receiver fix-up, and intra-node GPU placement uses diversity-aware greedy packing with a bounded 1x1 swap refinement. Final mappings are built with vectorized scatter/gather for efficiency.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from bounded candidate sets, single-swap refinements, and vectorized operations; however, balancedness is only moderate, likely due to the conservative one-pass refinement steps. Allowing iterative or broader swap/refinement passes could improve balance at some cost to runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical waterfill and diverse-heap MoE balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: capacity-aware LPT to assign groups to nodes, per-node water-filling replica counts with a D’Hondt/Sainte–Laguë hybrid tail and a small donor→receiver fix-up, then diversity-aware greedy GPU packing with a label-spreading seed and bounded 1x1/2x2 swap refinement. Uses Torch tensor ops (sort/topk/repeat_interleave/scatter) and fast paths for unique labels and unit capacities to keep it lean and deterministic.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the heuristics and fast paths are efficient, but the relatively low balancedness suggests the limited refinement (max two donor moves and shallow swap passes) leaves peak loads higher than optimal. Increasing refinement depth/iterations, stronger global swap searches, or more peak-aware tie-breaking during greedy placement could improve balance without severely impacting speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 75 - Patch Name hybrid_tail_waterfill - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid apportionment EPLB with slack-spread packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical packing (groups→nodes via LPT-style balanced_packing), then per-node hybrid apportionment (bulk D’Hondt plus peak-aware Sainte–Laguë/D’Hondt tail) to assign replica counts, followed by slack-first label-spread GPU placement with capacity and anti-duplication plus a single bounded 1x1 peak-capping swap; builds contiguous physical-to-logical maps and ranks via vectorized PyTorch ops. This design ensures ≥1 replica per expert, maintains per-GPU capacity constraints, and minimizes peak load with low overhead.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306931, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from vectorized bulk apportionment and limiting to a single smoothing swap; balancedness is reasonable but leaves room for further peak reduction via additional or smarter local refinements. Robust handling of zero-weight and edge cases was observed, with stable hierarchical behavior across nodes/GPUs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 76 - Patch Name apportion_slack_spread_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical expert-parallel load balancer with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-stage EPLB: (1) greedy balanced_packing with bounded multi-swap refinement to place groups on nodes, (2) hybrid replication using D'Hondt bulk plus peak-aware Sainte-Laguë tail with a one-move fix-up, and (3) packing physical experts to GPUs. Uses Torch scatter/inverse permutation mappings and runs sorting/packing on CPU floats.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66: balancedness_score 0.311848 and speed_score 1.000000 across 5 workloads; all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Greedy packing with limited refinement and a single local replication fix-up maximizes speed but leaves noticeable imbalance. Raising refine_steps or allowing multiple improving moves per row could improve balancedness at some cost to speed; hierarchical mode assumes groups divide nodes, otherwise it falls back to a global policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_and_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a greedy, CPU-friendly balanced_packing with bounded heavy–light refinement; replicate_experts combines bulk D’Hondt allocation with a peak-aware Sainte–Laguë vs D’Hondt tail and a donor/receiver fix-up. A hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, and packs to GPUs with stable rank reassignment; weights are processed on CPU for speed.
- **Performance**: Combined 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all tests; excellent speed from greedy packing and limited refinement, but moderate balancedness indicates room for stronger refinement or fix-up to reduce peak load. The hierarchical policy likely improves locality while inheriting the core heuristic’s balancing limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 78 - Patch Name moe_eplb_peakaware_tail_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical mapping: balanced packing of groups to nodes, water-filling replica allocation with a small donor→receiver fix-up, then diversity-aware greedy GPU placement with label-spreading and bounded 1x1/2x2 refinement. Final maps are built via scatter/inverse permutations, keeping per-expert contiguous ranks and CPU-based tensor ops.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0 (fails all validation tests).
- **Feedback**: A critical bug in pack_diverse_heap references undefined variable num_items (should be n_items), causing a runtime failure. Beyond this, the approach depends on permutation assumptions in inverse/scatter and tight capacity arithmetic; add validations for per-pack capacity and index ranges to prevent subtle mapping errors.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 79 - Patch Name peakaware_fixup_and_diversity_guard - Correct Program: False

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Hybrid replication with D’Hondt bulk plus Sainte–Laguë tail and a single guarded donor→receiver fix-up consistently delivers the top balancedness at perfect speed.
  - Current best: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Greedy Refinement (Gen70, 0.311848 balancedness, 1.00 speed, combined 0.66) uses hybrid allocator with a post-fix move; similar top performers include Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication (Gen72, 0.311848) and Hierarchical expert-parallel load balancer with hybrid replication (Gen77, 0.311848).
- Bounded heaviest↔lightest swap refinement boosts balance with negligible overhead.
  - Best-in-class uses searchsorted-based 1x1 swaps with small budgets: refine_steps=1 at the group→node layer and refine_steps=2 at the GPU layer (Gen70, Gen72, Gen77 all at 0.311848).
- Deterministic, hierarchical pipeline with CPU-friendly tensor ops maintains speed and correctness.
  - Stable mappings via inverse permutations and scatter/gather, plus fast paths (capacity==1, unique-label) are common to the top cluster (e.g., Gen70, Gen72, Gen73, Gen75).
- Diversity-aware GPU packing with bounded 1x1/2x2 local swaps keeps speed at 1.00 while preserving balance quality.
  - Seen in Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diverse Packing (Gen71, 0.311), Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid water-filling (Gen73, 0.311), and Hierarchical waterfill and diverse-heap MoE balancer (Gen75, 0.311077).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Water-filling-centric replication trails the hybrid tail by a consistent margin in balancedness.
  - Hierarchical Water-Fill EPLB with Diverse Packing (Gen71) and variants (Gen73, Gen74, Gen75, Gen78) score ~0.311–0.311077 balancedness vs. 0.311848 for hybrid-tail leaders, with feedback attributing the gap to limited fix-ups and local swap scope.
- Underpowered refinement budgets or shallow fix-ups leave measurable imbalance.
  - Hybrid apportionment EPLB with slack-spread packing (Gen76) achieves 0.306931 balancedness despite perfect speed; the single bounded swap is cited as a limiting factor for peak reduction compared to the top cluster’s small but more effective refinement.
- Implementation errors in packing logic break correctness entirely.
  - Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer (Gen79) fails all validations due to an undefined variable in pack_diverse_heap (num_items vs. n_items), demonstrating the fragility of permutation/packing code without strict variable discipline.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Hybrid replication tail: D’Hondt bulk plus per-step Sainte–Laguë/Huntington–Hill A/B tail with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up that only triggers on strict global peak reduction (Gen70). This mirrors other top implementations using D’Hondt bulk + Sainte–Laguë tail with a guarded fix-up (Gen72, Gen77), all reaching 0.311848 balancedness.
  - Small, targeted swap refinement: Searchsorted-based best 1x1 swap between heaviest and lightest packs reduces max imbalance per iteration with negligible CPU cost; applied asymmetrically across layers (groups: 1 step; GPUs: 2 steps) in Gen70.
  - Deterministic hierarchical mapping: Groups→nodes→GPUs composition with inverse permutations and scatter keeps results reproducible and passes all validations, while CPU-side float ops and fast paths preserve speed (Gen70, Gen72).
- Coding patterns linked to outcomes:
  - Greedy, capacity-aware packing establishes a strong baseline; bounded, targeted swaps push balancedness into the top tier without harming speed (Gen70, Gen72, Gen77).
  - Diversity-aware GPU placement with small local 1x1/2x2 swaps is sufficient when paired with the hybrid tail; broader, heavier strategies are unnecessary for speed 1.00 (Gen71, Gen73, Gen75).
  - Water-filling allocation with limited local fix-ups regularly underperforms the hybrid tail by ~0.0007–0.0008 balancedness (Gen71, Gen73–Gen75, Gen78).

## Performance Analysis
- The top balancedness cluster is driven by hybrid-tail replication plus small, effective refinements.
  - Gen70, Gen72, Gen77 score 0.311848 balancedness at speed 1.00 (combined 0.66), leading all evaluated programs.
- Water-filling replication variants form a second cluster with slightly lower balancedness at the same speed.
  - Gen71, Gen73, Gen74, Gen75, Gen78 sit around 0.311–0.311077 balancedness (combined 0.66), matching earlier observations that water-filling + small fix-ups trail hybrid-tail approaches by ~0.0007–0.0008.
- Conservative refinement limits balancedness even within hierarchical frameworks.
  - Gen76 at 0.306931 confirms that single-swap or minimal refinement budgets leave residual peak skew, despite perfect speed and correct hierarchical behavior.
- Correctness is binary and speed is uniformly maximal among passing programs; balancedness exclusively differentiates scores.
  - All passing programs achieve speed 1.00; the decisive levers are replication tail choice and the presence of small, targeted heavy↔light swap refinements. The current best (Gen70) exemplifies both.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Make the hybrid tail truly adaptive per step with a peak-aware chooser. Keep the current D’Hondt bulk, but for the last T = max(1, round(0.1 · num_redundant)) allocations in each row, at every step evaluate both the D’Hondt and Sainte–Laguë best picks by simulating the new averages and selecting the assignment that minimizes (new_peak, new_second_peak, receiver_count). This preserves the winning hybrid structure while directly optimizing the objective at the tail where it matters most.

2. Expand the guarded replication fix-up from 1 to up to 2 moves with a tiny, peak-focused candidate set. For each row, form donors from the top-2 experts by current average and receivers from the bottom-2; evaluate all candidate donor→receiver moves in parallel, pick the one minimizing (new_peak, new_second_peak, post-move donor_avg) and apply only if it strictly reduces the peak, then optionally repeat once. Continue to select the physical column with the highest replica rank for the donor, keeping the operation cheap and deterministic.

3. Add a bounded 2x2 fallback swap in the packer when the 1x1 heaviest↔lightest swap stalls. In CapacityPacker._refine_single_layer, if the 1x1 searchsorted swap yields no strict delta reduction, try at most one 2x2 swap between the heaviest and lightest packs by evaluating the best pair among top-2 heavy items and top-2 light items (minimizing the resulting max pack load). Commit only if it reduces the peak; this retains speed while unlocking small extra gains seen in diverse-aware variants.

4. Introduce diversity-aware tie-breaking for GPU packing to avoid co-locating replicas of the same logical expert. Extend balanced_packing to accept optional item labels and per-pack label counts; during greedy placement, when multiple GPUs have equal current load, choose the GPU where the item’s label (logical expert id) is least frequent in that pack (prefer unseen). Use this only as a tie-breaker to keep the fast lightest-pack heuristic intact and maintain determinism.

5. Make GPU-layer refinement steps adaptive to residual imbalance. After the initial greedy placement at the GPU layer, compute delta = max(pack_w) − min(pack_w); if delta/mean(pack_w) exceeds a small threshold (e.g., 2%), allow one extra refinement step (refine_steps = 3 instead of 2) for that row only. This targets the few outlier rows that still drive the global peak, preserving the 1.00 speed profile on average.
