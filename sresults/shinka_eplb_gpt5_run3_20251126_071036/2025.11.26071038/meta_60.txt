# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer for vLLM**
- **Implementation**: Implements a greedy, hierarchical rearrangement using PyTorch: groups are packed to nodes, experts replicated within nodes, and physical experts packed to GPUs via a balanced_packing heuristic, with permutations managed by scatter/gather and an inverse mapping. Computation is performed primarily on CPU (weight.float().cpu()) with per-layer greedy choices and fixed replica counts used to build phy→log, log→phy, and expert count maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy packing and CPU-based tensor ops, but yields only moderate load balance. Hierarchical constraints and per-layer greedy decisions (e.g., weight/logcnt replication and group-first packing) likely limit balancedness compared to more global or optimal assignments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical strategy: groups→nodes via balanced packing, per-node “water-filling” replication, and diversity-aware greedy assignment of replicas to GPUs that minimizes label collocation while equalizing per-pack load; permutation inverses and scatter build physical↔logical maps. Trivial/fast paths (e.g., one item per pack, no-duplicate labels) and CPU-friendly loops via list conversions keep overhead low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The diversity-aware step reduces hotspotting of identical labels, but the equal-items-per-pack constraint and greedy choices yield only moderate load balance. Efficient early exits and lightweight loops drive the top speed score.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name diversity_aware_gpu_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy sort-based bin packing per layer with a small local 2-opt-style refinement between heaviest/lightest packs. Replication is selected via argmax(weight/logcnt) within nodes, then replicas are packed to GPUs; final mappings are built via gather/scatter and inverse permutations, operating on CPU tensors for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306805, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed shows the greedy + limited refinement is lightweight, but moderate balancedness indicates room for stronger global balancing. More refinement iterations or smarter swap selection could improve balance; hierarchical policy is used when groups align with nodes, otherwise a global fallback is applied.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name local_swap_refine_in_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Serpentine Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses vectorized serpentine (snake) packing per layer to evenly assign sorted experts to packs, and a d'Hondt-like greedy replicator that allocates extra replicas by weight/count. A hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs using amortized loads, implemented with PyTorch scatter/gather and permutation inverses (with a fast path when groups_per_pack==1).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.63 (balancedness 0.254285, speed 1.00; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Fully vectorized design achieves maximal speed but modest balancedness, suggesting the greedy replication plus snake packing underperform under skewed loads. Correctness is solid (passes all tests); balancedness may improve with local swap/refinement or more global optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name eplb_snake_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Diversity-Aware Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical three-stage pipeline: (1) greedy group-to-node packing with up to 4 heaviest/lightest swaps, (2) per-node expert replication via an incremental ratio (weight/count) greedy update, and (3) GPU placement with diversity-aware packing that prioritizes label spread then projected load. Mapping inverses and placements are built via scatter/gather for efficiency, with selective CPU sorting and minimal refinement to keep runtime low.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.3068, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests. It prioritizes speed—greedy choices and limited local refinement yield maximal runtime performance but only moderate balance; diversity-aware packing helps reduce hotspotting, though the capped refinements likely limit balancedness gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name diverse_pack_projload_and_incremental_ratio - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with diversity-aware packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical strategy: groups are packed to nodes via balanced_packing, logical experts are replicated with Hamilton’s method (largest remainder) in replicate_experts, and physical experts are assigned to GPUs using a diversity-aware greedy packer that spreads identical labels to reduce hotspotting. Mappings are built with vectorized torch ops (scatter/inverse), and the top-level casts weights to CPU for consistent, fast execution.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.2897, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy policies and vectorized construction of mappings, but balancedness is modest, indicating the greedy packing and proportional replication may under-serve heavy experts or miss global optimality. Consider stronger global balancing heuristics or improved tie-breaking beyond label diversity to raise balancedness without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name proportional_quota_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs logical expert groups to nodes, greedily replicates experts within nodes, then balances physical experts across GPUs. The core balanced_packing uses per-layer greedy assignment with fixed per-pack item counts and a lightweight single-swap refinement; replicate_experts greedily allocates by current load (weight/logcnt), and mappings are built via scatter/gather operations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to simple greedy passes and minimal refinement, but achieves only moderate balance. Single-swap local improvement and equal-cardinality packing likely cap balancedness; nevertheless, the solution is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name single_swap_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and D’Hondt Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer (sort-by-weight, place into lightest pack) with a single heaviest↔lightest swap refinement and deterministic in-pack ranks; replica allocation is a vectorized D’Hondt-style water-filling. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes and GPUs via permutation ops (including a scatter-based inverse), with replication done per node and final mappings produced by gather/scatter.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The lightweight greedy packing favors speed but leaves noticeable imbalance; increasing refinement steps or applying smarter swap/refinement strategies could raise balancedness with modest cost. Vectorized allocation and permutation-based layout keep the approach simple and fast, and all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name moe_eplb_modular_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer greedy balanced_packing (descending sort with capacity-constrained assignment) plus up to two bounded heavy-light swaps to reduce imbalance while reassigning ranks. Applies a hierarchical strategy: pack groups to nodes, greedily replicate experts via weight/logcnt, then pack physical experts to GPUs; mappings are constructed via gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed from lightweight greedy steps and limited refinement, but modest balancedness suggests under-optimization of load distribution. More aggressive or global refinement could improve balance at the expense of speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name multi_swap_refinement_balanced_packing - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: RR-WF Packing with Hare Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements Round-Robin Waterfilling packing to assign items to packs in capacity rounds, with a lightweight post-swap refinement; uses Hare (Hamilton) largest-remainder to allocate replicas proportionally, then a hierarchical pipeline (group→node packing, intra-node replication, GPU packing) built with vectorized torch gathers/scatters and an inverse-permutation utility. The entry rebalance forces weight to float().cpu() and selects hierarchical when groups % nodes == 0, otherwise a global fallback.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.64 (balancedness 0.289706, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple per-round vectorized ops, stable sorting, and minimal refinement; per-row loops (remainders/topk, final swap) are lightweight. Balance is improved over naive strategies but remains moderate, suggesting headroom beyond the single-pass RR-WF plus optional one-swap refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name rr_waterfill_hare - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill + Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a three-stage hierarchical balancer: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, intra-node water-filling replica allocation via binary search with greedy extras, and GPU placement using a diversity-aware heap that minimizes (label repeats, load, fill). It builds contiguous phy2log/rank with repeat_interleave, inverts mappings where needed, and scatters logical→physical indices; falls back to a single-node policy when groups aren’t node-aligned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000) across 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU sorts, vectorized gathers/scatters, and simple greedy heuristics, but achieves only moderate balance. Balancedness likely suffers from the greedy capacity-constrained packers and per-node isolation; tuning the packing objective or more global optimization could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name waterfill_diverse_heap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diverse Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical packing of logical experts to nodes and GPUs: greedy capacity-constrained packing with K=2 heavy–light swaps, diversity-aware packing to spread identical labels, and a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replication strategy. Uses vectorized gathers/scatters and invert-permutation helpers to build physical↔logical maps and replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.304918, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: All tests passed; packing and replication are fast, yielding top speed but only moderate balance. The limited K=2 refinement and local (per-node) swaps likely cap balancedness despite diversity-aware placement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical policy: packs expert groups to nodes with capacity-aware LPT, performs per-node water-filling replication with a one-step donor→receiver fix, then assigns to GPUs via a diversity-aware heap plus a k=2 swap refinement. Builds physical→logical and logical→physical maps via scatter/gather with contiguous replica ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent, indicating low overhead from the greedy/heap steps and CPU tensor ops. Balancedness is modest, suggesting the single-step fix and limited 2-opt swap cap equalization, leaving room for deeper refinement if needed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name k2_swap_tail_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert-parallel balancer: groups are greedily packed to nodes with a bounded multi-swap refinement (max_swaps=2), replicas are allocated per layer via a D’Hondt-like scheme with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, and physical experts are then packed to GPUs; mappings use gather/scatter with inverse permutations for determinism. Packing operates on CPU tensors with stable rank reassignment to maintain per-pack ordering.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy heuristics and tightly bounded refinement, but balancedness is moderate, likely limited by the two-swap bound and single-step replica fix-up. Hierarchical placement benefits topology-aware locality when groups are node-divisible; otherwise it falls back to a global policy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name replication_fixup_one_step - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-layer sorted greedy balanced_packing with exact items-per-pack and a bounded (max 2) multi-swap refinement to reduce imbalance. Replication applies a D’Hondt-like greedy allocation plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs with inverse maps and stable ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed but moderate balancedness, likely limited by the small swap budget and single-step replication correction. The hierarchical policy preserves locality and determinism; increasing refinement steps could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name one_step_replication_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB Hybrid Hierarchical Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical expert balancing with a hybrid D’Hondt→Sainte-Laguë replica apportionment (plus a one-step fix-up), greedy capacity-constrained packing with k=2 best-improvement swaps, and a diversity-aware GPU assignment tie-breaker. Uses permutation inversion utilities and staged refinement (1 step for groups→nodes, 2 steps for physical→GPU packing).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The replica fix-up moves a seat from the highest-average “donor” to the lowest-average “receiver,” which worsens imbalance (direction should be receiver→donor), likely breaking correctness. Additionally, layout reshaping/gather assumes block-contiguous permutations and the forced .cpu() cast may violate expected device semantics, contributing to failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name hydra_k2_diversity_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses capacity-constrained greedy packing over sorted weights with bounded multi-swap refinement; hierarchical grouping packs groups→nodes and replicas→GPUs via inverse-permutation mappings. Replication applies a D’Hondt allocation with a Sainte-Laguë tail and a single donor→receiver fix-up, with deterministic rank reassignment.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65; balancedness_score 0.304918, speed_score 1.000000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: The limited refinement (refine_steps=1–2) and one-step fix-up prioritize speed but leave noticeable imbalance. Increasing swap iterations or applying richer local search could improve balancedness at some runtime cost; all validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallel Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: packs expert groups to nodes via greedy balanced_packing with bounded multi-swap refinement, replicates experts using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) allocator plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up, then packs physical replicas to GPUs. Uses CPU-based sorting/scatter and stable rank reassignment, with inverse mappings for logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed indicates the greedy, bounded-swap design and CPU-side ops keep overhead low. Balancedness is moderate, likely constrained by the single-step replica fix-up and small refine_steps; allowing more refinement or multi-move adjustments could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name hybrid_sainte_lague_tail_and_stage_specific_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Diversity-Aware EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Performs hierarchical load balancing: packs expert groups to nodes with greedy balanced packing, replicates experts per node by max normalized load, then assigns replicas to GPUs using diversity-aware greedy packing with a single k=2 best-improvement swap; mappings use vectorized gather/scatter for efficiency. Includes a fast path when labels are unique and tie-breakers to reduce label duplication per pack.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; the diversity-aware greedy plus minimal refinement achieves excellent speed but only moderate balance. More aggressive refinement (multi-swap or iterative improvement) could raise balancedness, though current design already reduces hotspotting from replica co-location.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name k2_micro_swap_diverse - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and hybrid apportionment**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical load balancer: packs groups to nodes, replicates experts within nodes using a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a one-step fix-up, then assigns physical experts to GPUs via balanced packing. The packing is a sorted greedy placement with capacity constraints plus bounded local multi-swap refinement; mappings are constructed with gather/scatter and inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validation tests. Excellent speed due to bounded refinement and lightweight apportionment, while moderate balancedness indicates potential gains from higher refine_steps or multi-iteration replication adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name refine_packing_and_hybrid_replication - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- Implementation: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with per-layer targeted heavy-light swaps (searchsorted-based) determines group/node/GPU placement; a hierarchical layout uses permutation inverses to keep groups contiguous and then packs per-GPU experts after replication. Replication employs hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a one-step donor→receiver fix-up; deterministic intra-pack ranks and vectorized torch ops are used throughout.
- Performance: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000, 5 workloads).
- Feedback: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; limited refinement steps and the single-step replication fix-up likely cap balancedness. Increasing refine_steps or enabling multi-swap/multi-move adjustments could improve balance at some cost in speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name moe_eplb_crossover_capacityperm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical staging: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, water-filling replication per node with a top-2 donor/bottom-2 receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a k=2 swap refinement. Physical↔logical maps and ranks are built via repeat_interleave and scatter/gather with exact per-pack capacities.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Correct and fast, but balancedness is only moderate, suggesting the greedy packing and limited local refinements reduce peaks but don’t fully equalize load. Stronger global adjustments could further improve balance without sacrificing speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name top2_replica_fix_and_tieaware_pack - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with greedy packing and quota replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses a capacity-constrained greedy packer with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps and an adaptive second swap; replication allocates via a D’Hondt bulk phase followed by per-row Sainte-Laguë vs Huntington–Hill selection and a single-move donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical policy packs groups to nodes and physical experts to GPUs, with fast permutation inverses and scatter-based map construction and deterministic in-pack ranking.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.306257, speed 1.000000 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Minimal refinement and simple scans preserve peak speed but cap balance quality; adaptive tail sizing (via coefficient of variation) and hierarchical staging improve robustness. The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name eplb_k2swap_hybrid_apportion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a bounded k=2 heaviest-lightest swap refinement, combined with hierarchical node/group/GPU placement. Replication uses a hybrid D’Hondt (bulk) + Sainte-Laguë (tail) apportionment with a single best-improving donor→receiver fix-up to reduce peak average load.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The algorithm is very fast due to greedy packing and limited local refinement, but balancedness is modest, suggesting the k=2 swap and single fix-up move under-correct skew. Increasing refine_steps, considering larger swap candidate sets, or multiple fix-up iterations could improve balance at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name adaptive_refine_and_replication_fixup_k2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with k-swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical three-stage balancer: groups-to-nodes via greedy packing plus bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, intra-node expert replication using apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail) with a one-move fix-up, then GPU packing with a diversity-aware tie-break; deterministic ranking and inverse-permutation utilities included. Core loops run on CPU for control flow, with small-k refinement and optional adaptive second swap for improved local balance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Achieves maximal speed due to lightweight CPU-driven greedy packing and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest. Increasing refine_steps/k, strengthening swap search, or more aggressive diversity penalties could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name dhh_diverse_k2_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EPLB: Hierarchical Hybrid Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a CPU-friendly greedy balanced_packing with per-layer sort, capacity-aware assignment, and bounded heaviest-lightest refinement swaps; replicate_experts applies a hybrid apportionment (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a one-step donor→receiver fix-up. Hierarchical rebalancing packs groups to nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs replicas to GPUs, with permutation inverses and rank-aware log2phy scatter for final maps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy CPU paths and limited refinement, while balancedness is modest likely due to small refine_steps and single-step replication fix-up. The hierarchical policy favors locality and stability but may under-balance globally in some distributions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name moe_eplb_hybrid_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB)**
- **Implementation**: Staged pipeline: GroupPacker does LPT-style greedy packing with a bounded k=2 best-improvement swap; ReplicaAllocator apportions replicas via D’Hondt bulk then A/B between Sainte-Laguë and Huntington–Hill with a single donor→receiver correction; GpuPlacer uses greedy projected-load assignment with a diversity-aware tie-breaker and adaptive k=2 refinement. Hierarchical mapping packs groups to nodes, allocates within nodes, then places to GPUs, with a global fallback when grouping doesn’t align with nodes.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.299, speed 1.000) over 5 workloads; all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Perfect speed shows the heuristics are lightweight and implementation efficient, while modest balancedness suggests the greedy choices and single bounded swaps leave residual imbalance. The apportionment tail improves peak per-replica averages and the diversity tie-breaker helps spread replicas, but limited refinement likely caps balancing quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name eplb_pipeline_apportion_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical 3-step pipeline: capacity-aware LPT packing of groups to nodes, per-(layer,node) water-filling replication with a small donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with a unique-label fast path and a single 2-opt swap; mappings are built via vectorized torch gather/scatter with contiguous ranks per expert. Assumes exact per-pack capacity and enforces at least one replica per logical expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.00 over 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: The approach is fast due to simple sorts, limited local refinements, and lightweight CPU tensor ops, but balancedness is modest, likely bounded by the greedy packing and shallow (k≤2) fix-ups. Deeper refinement or broader swap searches could improve balance at a small runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name moe_eplb_waterfill_diverse_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with zig-zag packing and water-filling**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical balancer: groups are stripe-packed (zig-zag) to nodes, experts replicated in-node via water-filling (binary search + greedy rounding), and replicas stripe-packed to GPUs using per-replica average load; mappings are built with scatter/gather and permutation inverses for deterministic phy2log/log2phy. Runs on CPU tensors, enforces exact per-pack capacity, and ignores refine_steps in packing for simplicity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.310534, speed 1.000000) over 5 workloads; all validations pass.
- **Feedback**: Extremely fast but only moderately balanced; the single-pass stripe packing and batched rounding in water-filling (full-round increments before top-k) likely cap balance quality. Iterative refinement or stricter marginal-benefit allocation for remaining replicas could improve balancedness without large runtime penalties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name waterfill_stripe_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with K-swap Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with bounded k=2 best-improvement swaps, plus a diversity-aware tie-break for near-ties. Hierarchical pipeline: pack groups to nodes, replicate via vectorized minimax with a one-move fix-up, then pack replicas to GPUs; outputs deterministic ranks and mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.308909, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed comes from lightweight CPU control flow and vectorized allocation steps, but the small k and swap budget bias toward speed over balance, resulting in modest balancedness. Increasing refine_steps/k or strengthening the post-allocation fix-up could improve balance; the very small diversity penalty likely has limited impact.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name moe_eplb_minimax_replicator - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication and k-candidate refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing with fixed pack sizes and a bounded k=2 swap refinement to reduce per-pack imbalance, while maintaining stable in-pack ranks. Replication is allocated via a hybrid apportionment (D'Hondt bulk, Sainte-Laguë tail) plus a single best donor→receiver fix-up; a hierarchical pipeline maps groups→nodes, replicates within nodes, then packs physical experts to GPUs, using gather/scatter inversion for mappings.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement (k=2, max 2 swaps) and single-move fix-up keep it very fast but limit final balance quality. Increasing swap candidates/iterations or allowing multi-move adjustments could improve balancedness at some cost to speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name k2_refine_and_stronger_replication_fix - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Waterfill and Diverse Packing EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Uses water-filling replica allocation (binary search + greedy extras) with a small donor→receiver fix-up, hierarchical group-to-node LPT-like packing, and diversity-aware heap GPU placement with label-aware tie-breaking plus bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps; mappings are composed via gather/scatter with inverse permutations. Optimized fast paths exist for trivial capacities and unique labels, and ranks are kept contiguous per expert.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The approach is very fast due to lightweight CPU tensor ops, constrained candidate sets, and early-exit paths, but achieves only moderate balance. Limited refinement depth (k=2 swaps, two fix-up iterations) and greedy packing likely leave headroom for improved peak smoothing, though the solution is correct and passes all validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name light2_and_pair_swap_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB with Diverse GPU Packing**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical placement: group-to-node balanced packing (capacity-aware LPT), per-node water-filling replica allocation with a donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap GPU packing with a bounded 1x1 swap refinement. Mapping is built via vectorized gather/scatter with contiguous replica ranks and robust edge-case handling (e.g., capacity=1, all-zero weights).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66; balancedness 0.3111, speed 1.0000 across 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; excellent speed from greedy heuristics and minimal refinement. Balancedness is modest, likely limited by the single-step donor/receiver tweak and bounded 1x1 swap, indicating potential gains from deeper or iterative refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name replicate_fixup_and_light2_refinement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical 3-stage balancer: groups→nodes via greedy packing with 1-step k×k refinement, intra-node replication using a hybrid D’Hondt/Sainte-Laguë (tail selected by simulation) plus a capped 2-move fix-up, and GPU placement via diversity-aware packing with adaptive depth and optional 2×2 swaps. Deterministic ranks and inverse permutations ensure stable layouts; control-flow heavy parts run on CPU.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00) over 5 workloads; passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strong speed stems from bounded k=2 candidate swaps and limited refinement, but balancedness is modest, likely due to 1-step refinement in group packing and disabled 2×2/second-light in the base pass. Increasing refine_steps or enabling broader light-pack candidates/2×2 in balanced_packing should improve balance with minimal impact on speed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name moe_eplb_dualrefine_tailabc - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Diversity-aware hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses hierarchical packing (groups→nodes, replicate within nodes, then pack to GPUs) with water-filling-based replication plus a donor→receiver fix-up, and a diversity-aware balanced packing that spreads identical labels and applies a single 1x1 swap refinement between heavy/light packs. Provides invertible mappings and ranks, with a CPU float normalization at the entry point for consistency.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.3111, speed_score 1.0; 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from greedy assignment and bounded refinement. Balancedness is moderate; the one-swap refinement and local greedy choices improve hotspots but leave headroom for further imbalance reduction. The program is correct and passed all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name waterfill_and_light_pair_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing with deterministic in-pack ranking and a targeted heaviest↔lightest swap (searchsorted-based) refinement; fast-path for capacity==1. Employs a hierarchical policy (groups→nodes), hybrid D’Hondt then Sainte-Laguë replication with a local fix-up move, and diversity-aware GPU packing with label-based tie-breaking and adaptive refinement; permutation inverses and scatters map between logical/meta/global IDs.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Lightweight refinement and greedy heuristics keep runtime excellent but leave balance suboptimal; increasing refinement steps or broader swap neighborhoods could improve balancedness. CPU staging in the diversity-aware step and Python loops did not impact this benchmark’s speed but may be a scalability consideration for larger inputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name eplb_hybrid_diverse_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Waterfill-Based Hierarchical vLLM Expert Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical placement: capacity-aware LPT group-to-node packing, water-filling replica allocation with guarded donor→receiver fix-ups (up to two moves), and diversity-aware heap-based GPU packing with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps and adaptive refinement; builds physical↔logical maps via tensor gather/scatter with exact per-pack capacities and contiguous replica ranks. 
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311077, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The bounded refinement and capped fix-ups prioritize speed but limit balancedness improvements, leaving residual peak load after water-filling. Diversity-aware packing improves label spread, yet the conservative swap policy may under-optimize the global max load across GPUs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 36 - Patch Name wf_diverse_refine2x2_adaptive - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: HH+D’Hondt Zigzag Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical policy: groups→nodes via deterministic zigzag packing, per-node replication via Huntington–Hill bulk apportionment with a small D’Hondt tail micro-tune and capped donor→receiver fix-ups, and GPU placement via label-interleaved zigzag with bounded heavy/light refinement (including optional 2x2 swaps). Exact pack capacities are enforced, with permutation inverses used to map between logical/physical indices.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.0 and failed all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Results likely violate the expected output contract (e.g., forcing tensors to CPU in rebalance_experts, potential permutation/device mismatches), causing correctness failures. Preserve input device for outputs, verify permutation assumptions for inverse mappings, and ensure the hierarchical remapping and refinement steps produce bitwise-identical outputs to prior versions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name interleaved_zigzag_apportion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: EPLB hierarchical expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy balanced packing per layer with bounded 1x1 and 2x2 swap refinement, and a hybrid replication scheme (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a small tail auto-tuning and per-row fix-up. Mapping is built hierarchically (groups→nodes→GPUs) with rank-consistent scatter/gather permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66: balancedness 0.311848 and speed 1.00 over 5 workloads; all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed is driven by capped refinement (max_swaps=2) and lightweight candidate sets, but balancedness is modest, likely due to conservative swap limits and limited post-replication adjustments. Increasing swap depth/candidates or strengthening the fix-up stage could improve load balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name adaptive_tail_fix_and_refine_2x2_secondlight - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Adaptive Refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical expert-parallel load balancer: groups→nodes→GPUs using greedy balanced_packing with adaptive bounded refinement (2–3 swaps, 1x1 and optional 2x2 exchanges) and hybrid expert replication (bulk D’Hondt + tail Sainte-Laguë) with a conditional second fix-up move. Uses gather/scatter-based inverses and rank maintenance to keep per-pack cardinality constraints while staying mostly on CPU for fast small-k operations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.0 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The program is correct and passes all validation tests. Speed benefits from bounded local search and lightweight replication tweaks, but limited swap depth and narrow candidate sets likely constrain balancedness; allowing deeper/more global refinements or broader candidate selection could improve balance at some runtime cost.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name adaptive_refine_and_two_step_fixup - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with adaptive k-swap refinement**
- **Implementation**: Implements hierarchical expert rebalancing: greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with adaptive k-candidate 1x1 and optional 2x2 swaps, integer water-filling (with D’Hondt continuation) for replication, and diversity-aware GPU packing; deterministic mappings are built via scatter/gather permutations and per-pack ranks. Control-flow-heavy steps run on CPU, with adaptive refinement depth based on imbalance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.65 (balancedness 0.309358, speed 1.000000 over 5 workloads); all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Maximal speed is driven by bounded refinement and lightweight heuristics, but balancedness is moderate, suggesting under-correction by the limited k and swap budget. Increasing refine_steps/k or enabling more aggressive 2x2 exchanges could improve load balance at a minor speed trade-off.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name waterfill_apportion_moe - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical vLLM Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Three-stage hierarchical EPLB: capacity-aware LPT packs groups to nodes, water-filling allocates replicas with a guarded donor→receiver fix-up (≤2 moves/row), and diversity-aware GPU packing uses bounded 1x1/2x2 refinements.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00 across 5 workloads).
- **Feedback**: The solution is correct and very fast, likely due to limited refinement steps and efficient vectorized operations. Balancedness is moderate, suggesting that broader swap/refinement or deeper search could further reduce peak load without severely impacting speed.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.000000; 5 workloads); all validation tests passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent; balancedness is moderate, reflecting the bounded refine_steps and single-move replication fix-up prioritizing speed over full optimality. The hierarchical and diversity-aware choices improve placement spread, but allowing more refinement or multi-swap strategies could further reduce peak imbalance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name best_swap_second_light_and_peak_guard - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB**
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical three-stage balancer: LPT-style group-to-node packing, water-filling replica allocation with a small donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap placement to GPUs with bounded 1x1/2x2 swaps plus a unique-label fast path. Final mappings are assembled via gather/scatter with inverse permutations.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness 0.311, speed 1.000 across 5 workloads); all validations passed.
- **Feedback**: Runtime is excellent due to greedy packing and lightweight refinements, but balancedness is modest, likely limited by local heuristics and shallow swap depth (k≤2, ≤2 passes). Broader refinement or tuned diversity penalties may improve peak smoothing without large speed regressions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name adaptive_gpu_refine_and_second_heaviest_swap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical water-fill expert load balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a three-stage hierarchical policy: capacity-aware LPT to pack groups to nodes, integer water-filling with a single donor→receiver fix-up for replication, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with one top-2 vs bottom-2 swap refinement; mapping inverses/scatters build the final indices, all on CPU tensors.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 (balancedness_score 0.311077, speed_score 1.000000 over 5 workloads); passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from simple greedy passes and bounded refinements, but balancedness is moderate—single-step fix-ups and limited swaps likely leave load skew under high variance. The hierarchical placement preserves capacity and diversity constraints reliably, suggesting deeper or iterative refinements could further improve balance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name top2_fixup_and_gpu_refine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with bounded refinement**
- **Implementation**: Uses greedy capacity-constrained packing per row with a k-candidate (k=2) heavy–light swap refiner, plus a diversity-aware variant that can consider second-light/heavy and optional 2x2 exchanges.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66; balancedness_score 0.311848; speed_score 1.000000 over 5 workloads.
- **Feedback**: Excellent speed stems from CPU-side control flow with small-k local search and limited refinement steps. Balancedness is moderate; enabling deeper refinement or broader 2x2 exchanges in the initial packing stage could improve load balance while retaining most of the speed benefits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name k2_refine_second_heavy_gpu_stage - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Water-Fill Expert Load Balancer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a hierarchical pipeline: capacity-aware LPT packing of groups to nodes with a micro 1x1 swap, water-filling replica allocation with a small donor→receiver fix-up, and diversity-aware heap packing to GPUs with label-aware 1x1/2x2 refinements and a unique-label fast path.

- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Forcing all tensors to CPU alters output device/dtype versus the expected API, likely causing failures. The hierarchical permutation/gather logic relies on strict divisibility assumptions and may misindex in edge cases, suggesting the need to preserve device, validate invariants, and robustly handle non-divisible configurations.

All computations run on CPU tensors with permutation inversions built via scatter/gather to produce phy→log, log→phy, and counts.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.0; fails all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The custom replication/packing heuristics and tie-breaking diverge from the expected EPLB behavior, producing incorrect mappings despite determinism and shape/device consistency. The apportionment-based replication and bounded swap refinements likely misalign with reference outputs, leading to systematic failures across test cases.

**Program Identifier:** Generation 54 - Patch Name eplb_strategic_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Hybrid Replication**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical EPLB: groups are greedily packed to nodes, intra-node replication uses a hybrid D'Hondt bulk plus Sainte-Laguë/Huntington–Hill tail with deterministic tie-breakers and a donor→receiver fix-up, and physical experts are packed to GPUs with a capacity-constrained greedy packer plus k=2 swap refinement.

It applies a hierarchical mapping (groups→nodes→GPUs) with inverse scatter/gather to produce stable physical↔logical maps and ranks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.66 with perfect speed (1.0) over 5 workloads; balancedness is moderate (0.311848).
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and very fast, owed to greedy packing with limited refinement and lightweight vectorized operations. Balancedness trails, suggesting gains from increasing swap iterations/candidate breadth or strengthening the post-optimization move while preserving determinism and runtime.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Hybrid replication tail (D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail) with a single guarded donor→receiver fix-up consistently achieves the top balancedness at perfect speed. Programs using this pattern reach balancedness ≈0.311848 and speed 1.00: Hierarchical EPLB with Greedy Packing and Hybrid Replication (Gen55), Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication and packing (Gen56), Hierarchical EPLB with hybrid replication (Gen58), Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer with Hybrid Replication (Gen59), and the current best program (balancedness 0.311848, speed 1.00).
- Targeted heavy↔light 1x1 swap refinement with bounded steps yields a small but reliable edge when paired with the hybrid replication tail. The current best program’s CapacityPacker uses searchsorted-based selection and refine_steps=1 for groups and 2 for GPUs, matching the top-scoring cluster’s approach.
- Deterministic CPU-side hierarchical composition with inverse-permutation gather/scatter preserves correctness and speed. The current best program’s group→node pack, intra-node replication, and GPU packing pipeline, combined with PermOps.inverse and contiguous replica ranks, sustains speed 1.00 while passing all validations.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Water-filling replication with small local fix-ups underperforms by ~0.0007–0.0008 in balancedness despite perfect speed. Examples: Hierarchical Water-Filling EPLB with Diverse Packing (Gen50, 0.311077), Hierarchical EPLB with Diversity Packing (Gen51, 0.3111), and Hierarchical EPLB with water-filling and diversity packing (Gen52, 0.311077).
- Huntington–Hill-centric allocation and Po2C GPU packing lag in balance. Cyclic-HH-Po2C Hierarchical Load Balancer (Gen57) achieves balancedness 0.298 (combined 0.65) with only a minimal fix-up and a single 1x1 micro-swap.
- Over-customized replication heuristics and tie-breaking can break correctness. Hierarchical Expert Load Balancer (Gen53) fails all validations (combined 0.0) due to apportionment-based replication and bounded swaps diverging from expected EPLB behavior, despite determinism and consistent tensor shapes.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Replication: replicate_experts uses D’Hondt bulk + a small Sainte-Laguë tail (~10% of redundant replicas, at least 1), then a one-move donor→receiver fix-up that only triggers when it strictly reduces the peak (via top-2 average load check). Donor selection takes the highest-rank replica to move; ranks and counts are updated deterministically.
  - Packing refinement: CapacityPacker’s searchsorted-based heavy↔light single-swap refinement minimizes the heavy–light delta and updates pack loads incrementally. Using refine_steps=1 for group→node and 2 for GPU packing matches the best cluster’s balancedness without hurting speed.
  - Hierarchical mapping with stable permutations: The pipeline composes log↔meta-log↔phy mappings using PermOps.inverse and gather/scatter, preserves contiguous replica ranks, and computes exact per-pack capacities (e.g., experts per GPU), which keeps speed at 1.00 and maintains validation correctness.
- Coding patterns that correlate with performance:
  - Greedy capacity-aware packing to the lightest pack with remaining capacity provides a strong baseline; small, bounded refinements add measurable gains.
  - CPU-centric control flow with vectorized tensor ops (repeat_interleave/gather/scatter, inverse permutations) avoids device/dtype issues and ensures reproducibility and throughput.

## Performance Analysis
- Clear stratification by replication strategy:
  - Top cluster (0.311848, speed 1.00): hybrid D’Hondt bulk + Sainte-Laguë tail with one guarded fix-up (Gen55, Gen56, Gen58, Gen59, and the current best).
  - Water-filling cluster (~0.311077–0.3111, speed 1.00): despite diversity-aware packing and bounded swaps (Gen50–Gen52), remains ~0.0007–0.0008 below the top.
  - HH/Po2C cluster (~0.298–0.299, speed 1.00): Cyclic-HH-Po2C (Gen57, 0.298) and a broader hybrid with a 10% apportionment tail (Gen54, 0.299) trail in balancedness (combined 0.65).
- Speed is uniformly 1.00 for all passing programs; balancedness is the differentiator. The hybrid replication tail determines the top tier, while targeted heavy↔light 1x1 swap refinement provides a small but consistent incremental benefit when combined with that tail.
- Correctness hinges on adhering to EPLB-consistent replication/packing semantics and robust permutation composition. Deviations (Gen53) result in outright failure (combined 0.0), whereas deterministic CPU pipelines with inverse permutations and exact capacity handling pass validations at full speed.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Upgrade the one-move replication fix-up to a 2×2 candidate set with a strict peak guard and second-order tie-break. In replicate_experts, form donors as the top-2 avg-loaded experts with count > 1 and receivers as the bottom-2 by avg; evaluate all four donor→receiver single moves and choose the one that minimizes the new peak (ties by the new second-highest avg). Move only one highest-rank donor replica per row and keep the strict new_peak < cur_max guard to preserve speed and determinism.

2. Make the Sainte-Laguë tail length adaptive per row based on load dispersion. Replace the fixed tail = max(1, ceil(0.1 · num_redundant)) with tail = clamp(1, num_redundant, round(alpha · num_redundant · s)), where alpha=0.10 and s is a bounded dispersion score (e.g., coefficient of variation of weight across experts clamped to [0.7, 1.3]). This keeps the hybrid structure but gives heavier-tailed rows a slightly longer SL tail, which tends to reduce peaks without extra cost.

3. Tail micro-AB between Sainte-Laguë and Huntington–Hill restricted to the last T picks. Keep D’Hondt for the bulk; for the last T tail picks, simulate two sequences of T allocations (SL vs HH) on per-row weight/logcnt and compute the predicted post-tail max avg (ties by second-highest). Choose the better tail deterministically, then run the existing guarded single fix-up; this adds a tiny CPU-only branch while preserving speed.

4. Broaden GPU-stage 1×1 swap partner search and pick the single best global swap per iteration. In CapacityPacker._refine_single_layer for the GPU stage (refine_steps=2), consider donors from {heaviest, second-heaviest} and receivers from {lightest, second-lightest, third-lightest}; for each pair, use the existing searchsorted nearest-match to evaluate the swap that minimizes the post-swap global max. Apply the best strictly improving swap, update pack loads incrementally, and keep one swap per step to retain speed.

5. Add a bounded two-swap chain fallback only under pronounced imbalance. If after attempting the best single 1×1 swap no strict improvement is possible and (max_load - min_load)/mean_load > 0.10, perform at most one two-swap chain: execute the best heavy↔light swap, recompute h/l, then attempt one more swap; commit the chain only if it strictly lowers the final max vs. the single-swap baseline. Apply this chain only in the GPU stage and keep refine_steps unchanged to preserve
