<DESCRIPTION>
Replacing the pairwise swap local search with a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) strategy. The LNS approach selects the heaviest pack, the lightest pack, and a pseudo-random third pack, collects all their items, and re-packs them using a Bounded Best-Fit heuristic. This allows for complex multi-item exchanges (like 3-way swaps or moving multiple small items to balance a large one) that are impossible with simple 1-to-1 swaps, helping to escape local optima where simple swaps are blocked by capacity constraints. The process repeats for up to 50 steps per restart.
