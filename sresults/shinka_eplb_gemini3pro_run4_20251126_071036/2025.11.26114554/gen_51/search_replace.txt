The Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) currently uses a greedy strategy followed by pairwise swaps. The following change upgrades the `balanced_packing` function to use a "Ruin and Recreate" (Large Neighborhood Search) approach. This method extracts items from the heaviest and lightest packs (and potentially a random third pack) and aggressively re-optimizes their distribution using multiple restarts of a randomized greedy solver. This effectively implements optimal two-bin repartitioning and three-way cyclic transfers to break local optima that single pairwise swaps cannot resolve.

<DESCRIPTION>
Replaced the pairwise swap refinement in `balanced_packing` with a robust Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) "Ruin and Recreate" loop.
- **Initialization**: Generates multiple candidate packings using Randomized LPT (Longest Processing Time) to find a good starting point.
- **LNS Refinement**: Iteratively selects a subset of packs (the max loaded, min loaded, and optionally a random pack) and pools their items. It then attempts to repack these items using a randomized greedy solver to minimize the local max load and variance. This enables multi-item swaps and cyclic transfers (A->B->C->A) that are superior to single pairwise swaps.
- **Efficiency**: All logic remains in Python scalar operations (lists) on the CPU, converting to tensors only at the very end, ensuring high speed.
