<DESCRIPTION>
1. Optimize `balanced_packing` by introducing randomized restarts (Multi-Start Greedy) and an improved refinement phase that considers swaps between the top-k heaviest packs and any lighter packs to escape local optima better than just max-min swaps.
2. Optimize `replicate_experts` by maintaining a running score tensor to avoid redundant division operations across the entire matrix in every iteration, reducing complexity from O(num_redundant * num_experts) to O(num_redundant).
