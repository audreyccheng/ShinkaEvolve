 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
 Expert parallelism load balancer (EPLB) for vLLM.
 
 This module implements the core rearrangement algorithm.
 
 The rearrangement algorithm is adapted from
 [DeepSeek EPLB](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/eplb).
 
 Please find at [#12](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/EPLB/issues/12) an example
 on how the EPLB algorithm works.
