re-greedy_pairwise_refinement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements a "Re-Greedy Pairwise Refinement" strategy in the `balanced_packing` function. Instead of merely swapping single items between the heaviest and lightest packs, this method pools all items from the two packs and re-distributes them using a randomized greedy heuristic (Noisy LPT) to minimize the load difference. This allows for multi-item swaps and better structural rebalancing, overcoming local optima where single swaps fail.
