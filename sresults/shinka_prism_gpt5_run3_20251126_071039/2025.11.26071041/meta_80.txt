# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy KVPR-Minimizing Model Placement**

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Direct slack-equalization around a target KVPR T is decisive. Programs that pack by weight w = dR + T·size and select the GPU minimizing nonnegative K_after = K_g − w consistently top the chart: the current best program (code provided), “KVPR-Minimizing GPU Model Placement via Slack Balancing” (Gen 71, 89.76, 0.006s), and “KVPR-balanced slack bin-packing for GPU placement” (Gen 74, 89.76, 0.006s) all use this rule.
- Compact T discovery with tight lower bounds and a tiny neighborhood is both fast and high quality. The best program’s multiplicative sweep from strong bounds (per-item/global/pair top-200/k-prefix) to find T_feas, followed by probing a narrow T neighborhood plus a short binary tightening, matches the approach in Gen 71/74/78 (all 89.76) and beats heavy binary/exponential-only searches seen in mid-20s scorers.
- Focused, bounded local search targeting the current worst GPU efficiently trims peak KVPR. The best program’s move/swap loop (≈18/8 budgets) mirrors the light refinements in Gen 71 and 74; these consistently reduce the measured max KVPR with negligible overhead (0.006s runtime, 1.000 success).
- Robustness features without overhead: explicit slo==0 handling (treated as memory-only in fallback), deterministic small randomization for tie-breaking, strict feasibility/memory checks, and a KVPR-aware greedy fallback appear across the top performers (current best, Gen 71, 74, 78; all 89.76, 1.000 success).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Transformed-weight packing not aligned with T-feasibility (e.g., w = n + T·m or resid/minmax hybrids) plateaued in the mid-20s despite rich heuristics: “KVPR-Minimizing Multi-Strategy Placement” (Gen 73, 26.24, 0.046s), “KVPR-Aware Parametric Packing with Local Search” (Gen 75, 26.24, 0.061s), and “KVPR-aware multi-heuristic GPU placement” (Gen 76, 26.24, 0.046s).
- Adding heuristic complexity without the K_after minimization rule did not break the plateau. Multi-operator local search (moves/swaps/2-opt), multi-start policies, and regret insertions in the 25–26 cluster did not approach the 89.76 group, and often increased runtime (e.g., Gen 73/75/76).
- Partial slack handling without tight T control underdelivered. A slack variant without equally strong T search/bounds scored only 26.06 (“KVPR-balanced placement via slack equalization,” Gen 72, 0.003s), showing that equalization must be paired with strong lower bounds and compact T refinement to reach top scores.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - K-slack formulation and decision rule: K_g = T·S − (ΣR_g + T·used_mem_g) with placement choosing the GPU minimizing nonnegative K_after. This directly enforces T-feasibility at assignment time and is shared by the top slack-balancing programs (Gen 71, 74, 78).
  - Tight lower bounds and compact T search: per-item/global/pair (top-200)/k-prefix seed a multiplicative sweep to T_feas; a tiny T neighborhood plus a brief binary tightening finds stronger placements without extra cost (0.006s).
  - Candidate diversity with strict evaluation: multiple orderings and choose rules (‘tight’ vs ‘min_kvpr’), light seeding of intrinsic-pressure items, deterministic small randomization, and lexicographic KVPR measurement to select the best candidate improve robustness and quality across cases.
  - Safety nets done right: slo==0 models are routed to the greedy fallback where they contribute zero demand (memory-only), and final memory safety checks ensure validity; these patterns are echoed in Gen 71/74/78 (all 89.76, 1.000 success).
  
## Performance Analysis
- Clear score stratification:
  - Top cluster at 89.76 with 0.006s runtime: current best program and slack-balancing peers (“KVPR-Minimizing GPU Model Placement via Slack Balancing,” Gen 71; “KVPR-balanced slack bin-packing for GPU placement,” Gen 74; “KVPR Slack-Balancing Placement with Greedy Fallback,” Gen 78).
  - Mid cluster around 26.24 and slower (0.046–0.061s): transformed-weight parametric pipelines (Gen 73/75/76).
  - Earlier slack variants achieved intermediate gains but lagged top results: 36.90 (“Balanced-Slack KVPR Minimization with Greedy Fallback,” Gen 79, 0.003s) and 26.06 (Gen 72, 0.003s).
- Slack equalization plus compact T handling explains the gap to the 26.xx cluster. Even when parametric variants were fast (e.g., “Min-Max KVPR GPU Placement,” 24.82, 0.006s), they did not close the quality gap to the 89.76 cluster, underscoring alignment with T-feasibility as the dominant factor.
- Local search scope correlates with efficiency: bounded, worst-GPU-focused refinement in the best program and Gen 71/74 maintains top scores at 0.006s, while heavier, broader local searches in the 26.xx group did not yield better placements and increased runtime.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Pre-place memory-only (slo==0) models before slack-equalization
   - Split models into M0 = {slo==0} and M+ = others. Place M0 largest-first onto GPUs with the most remaining memory (tie-break by fewest models), freeze per-GPU capacities Sg, then run the existing slack-equalization on M+ with K_g initialized as T·Sg and memory checks against Sg. Recompute lower bounds for M+ using S_total' = ΣSg and total_R' = Σ dR over M+, so memory-only models no longer force a greedy fallback and the T-feasibility rule remains intact.

2. Strengthen lower bounds and jump immediately to the max bound in the sweep
   - Add a triplet bound over the top P=120 items by size: for pairs (i,j) with max(si,sj) ≥ 0.55·S, scan k among the top-8-by-size items; if si+sj+sk > (k−1)·S and k·S−(si+sj+sk) > 0, set T ≥ (ri+rj+rk)/(k·S−(si+sj+sk)). Extend the k-prefix bound to k ≤ min(gpu_num, 6). In find_first_feasible_T, compute max_lb across {per-item, global, pair, k-prefix, triplet} and start T = max_lb (or jump to it if current T < max_lb) to avoid wasted multiplicative steps.

3. Correct T bracketing and compact polishing around the feasibility threshold
   - Replace the current hi initialization (which uses best_val) with a true bracket on T: set lo = lower, hi = T_feas found by the sweep, then binary search on feasibility for 6–8 iterations (using assign_balanced_slack as the feasibility oracle). Around the tightened T* (the smallest feasible T found), probe a very narrow neighborhood {0.99, 1.0, 1.01}·T* and keep the best measured KVPR. This aligns the search strictly with T-feasibility and preserves the compact, fast refinement that characterizes the top programs.

4. Residual-aware mid-placement T retuning with minimal disruption
   - During assign_balanced_slack, after ~40% of items are placed, recompute a residual lower bound using the remaining items and current per-GPU free memory (aggregate to S_total_rem and remaining total size); if residual_lb > 1.02·T, set T' = residual_lb, recompute w = dR + T'·size for the remaining items, resort them by w, and continue. Optionally do a light second retune at ~75% placed: update T in-place without reordering and use T' only for choose checks. This keeps the decision rule aligned with evolving feasibility without adding an outer loop.

5. Diversify near-optimal placements: micro-restarts with tiny K-jitter and lexicographic selection
   - At the best T candidate, run 3–5 micro-restarts that keep the same ordering but add tiny, deterministic jitter to per-GPU slack (e.g., K_g = T·S + ε·g, with ε ≈ 1e-6·T·S) and slightly different tie-break random seeds; this preserves feasibility but breaks pathological ties. When comparing candidates, switch from scalar max-KVPR to lexicographic KVPR vectors (sorted descending across GPUs) as the final tie-breaker. This combination consistently improved robustness in the top slack-equalization programs without measurable runtime cost.
