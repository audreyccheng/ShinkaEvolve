# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy KVPR-Minimizing Model Placement**

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Direct slack-equalization around a target KVPR T with K-after minimization consistently delivers top scores. Programs that compute K_g = T·S − (ΣR_g + T·used_mem_g) and place items by minimizing nonnegative K_after with weights w = dR + T·size are the clear winners: the current best program (Combined 89.76, max_kvpr 88.755, 0.006s), “Slack-equalized KVPR GPU placement” (Gen 81, 89.76, 0.006s), and “KVPR-Minimizing GPU Placement” (Gen 89, 89.76, 0.003s).
- Compact T discovery seeded by tight lower bounds plus a tiny neighborhood search is both fast and high quality. The best program uses per-item/global/pair(top-200)/k-prefix bounds, a multiplicative sweep to the first feasible T, probes a tight neighborhood, then a light binary tightening—mirroring Gen 81/89—achieving 89.76 with ≤0.006s runtime.
- Lightweight, worst-GPU-focused local refinement trims peak KVPR with negligible overhead. The best program’s bounded move/swap loop (≈18/8) aligns with Gen 81’s “bounded local move/swap refinement” and Gen 89’s “targeted moves/swaps,” maintaining 1.000 success while improving the measured max KVPR.
- Robustness features without cost: explicit slo==0 handling and greedy safety nets, deterministic tie-breaking, and strict memory/KVPR validation appear in the top performers (current best, Gen 81, Gen 89), sustaining 100% success at very low runtime.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Parametric transformed-weight pipelines without the K-after rule plateau around 26.24 despite complex heuristics. “Min-Max KVPR GPU Placement” (Gen 83, 26.24, 0.079s), “Multistage KVPR-Minimizing Placement” (Gen 84, 26.24, 0.051s), and “KVPR-Aware Multi-Strategy Placement” (Gen 85, 26.24, 0.077s) remain far below the 89.76 cluster.
- Adding heuristic complexity (multi-operator local search, 2-opt/donation, multi-starts) without T-feasible slack equalization increases runtime without closing the quality gap. The 26.xx cluster used extensive moves/swaps/2-opt and lexicographic selections yet failed to approach the top scores.
- Water-filling/dual-driven balancing not grounded in K-after at assignment underdelivers on KVPR. “Dual-driven KVPR Minimization Placement” (Gen 80, 25.55, 0.001s) is very fast and feasible but lags in KVPR reduction; feedback cites capped move budgets and simplistic assumptions (fixed 80GB) without the decisive slack-equalization rule.
- Partial slack handling without strong T control yields mid-tier results. Slack variants like “KVPR-Balanced GPU Model Placement” (Gen 82, 36.90, 0.003s) and “Balanced KVPR Slack Packing with Local Refinement” (Gen 86, 36.51, 0.002s) improve over 26.xx, but absence of compact T refinement and K-after-focused selection prevents reaching 89.76.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Tight lower bounds (per-item, global, pair over top-200 by size, k-prefix up to k=4) seed a multiplicative sweep to the first feasible T, followed by probing a compact T neighborhood and a brief binary tightening; this mirrors the strongest patterns in Gen 81/89 and explains the 89.76 score at 0.006s.
  - K-after selection rule enforces T-feasibility during packing: K_g initialized to T·S, each placement consumes w = dR + T·size, and the GPU minimizing nonnegative K_after is chosen, with optional min_kvpr tie-breaks and tiny randomized tie-breaking for stability/diversity.
  - Focused local search on the current worst GPU (bounded moves and swaps) reduces peak KVPR efficiently; combined with measuring and selecting the best among T variants and a refined greedy baseline, it yields robust improvements without runtime spikes.
- Coding patterns tied to robustness and speed:
  - Deterministic seeding (RNG keyed to problem size), multiple orderings (w_desc, intrinsic_desc, size_desc, density_desc), and strict feasibility checks (memory, KVPR <= T) consistently maintain 1.000 success.
  - Explicit slo==0 handling: the T-based pack rejects infinite dR (slo==0), cleanly triggering a greedy fallback that treats such models as memory-only—matching feedback from Gen 81/89 and ensuring correctness on edge cases.

## Performance Analysis
- Clear stratification:
  - Top cluster at 89.76 with 0.003–0.006s runtime and 1.000 success: current best program, Gen 81, and Gen 89—each using slack-equalization with K-after minimization and compact T search plus light refinement.
  - Mid cluster around 26.24 and slower (0.051–0.079s): multi-strategy parametric pipelines (Gen 83/84/85/87) that are feasible and stable but misaligned with T-feasibility at assignment.
  - Intermediate slack variants around 36.5–36.9 (Gen 82/86) show that slack packing helps, but without the full K-after plus compact T discovery, they fall well short of the top.
- Correlations:
  - Alignment with T-feasible slack equalization and compact T handling correlates directly with the highest combined scores and fastest runtimes.
  - Heavier local search breadth correlates with increased runtime without corresponding KVPR gains, as seen in the 26.xx cluster versus the best program’s tight worst-GPU-focused refinement.
  - Robust handling of slo==0, deterministic tie-breaking, and strict validation are common across all high scorers and contribute to the perfect success rate without sacrificing speed.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Pre-place memory-only (slo==0) models before T-based packing
   - Split models into M0 (slo==0) and M+ (slo>0). Place M0 largest-first onto GPUs with the most remaining memory (tie-break by fewest models), freeze per-GPU capacities Sg, then run the K-after slack-equalization on M+ with K_g initialized to T·Sg and memory checks against Sg. Recompute lower bounds for M+ using S_total' = ΣSg and total_R' over M+ so the T-feasible assignment never falls back to greedy just because of memory-only items.

2. Correct T bracketing and tighten via feasibility-only binary search
   - In find_first_feasible_T, return the first feasible T (T_feas) and treat lower as the lo bound. Replace the current hi initialization (which incorrectly uses best_val) with hi = T_feas, then perform 6–8 iterations of binary search using assign_balanced_slack as a pure feasibility oracle; after obtaining the smallest feasible T*, probe a compact neighborhood {0.99, 1.0, 1.01}·T* and keep the best measured KVPR. This aligns the search strictly with T-feasibility and matches the top-performing programs’ compact, fast polishing.

3. Strengthen lower bounds and jump directly to max bound
   - Add a triplet bound over the top P=120 items by size: for pairs (i,j) with max(si, sj) ≥ 0.55·S, scan k among the top-8-by-size items; if si+sj+sk > (k−1)·S and k·S−(si+sj+sk) > 0, set T ≥ (ri+rj+rk)/(k·S−(si+sj+sk)). Extend the k-prefix bound to k ≤ min(gpu_num, 6). In the multiplicative sweep, start at T = max(per-item, global, pair, k-prefix, triplet) to avoid wasted growth steps.

4. Residual-aware mid-placement T retuning
   - During assign_balanced_slack, after ~40% of items are placed, compute a residual lower bound using remaining items and current per-GPU free memory (aggregate to S_total_rem and remaining total size). If residual_lb > 1.02·T, set T' = residual_lb, recompute w = dR + T'·size for the remaining items, resort by w, and continue; optionally do a light second retune at ~75% placed (update T in-place without reordering). This keeps the K-after decision rule aligned with evolving feasibility at negligible overhead.

5. Micro-restarts with K-jitter, lexicographic comparison, and a quick K-aware move
   - At the best T candidate, run 3–5 micro-restarts that keep the same ordering but initialize K_g = T·Sg + ε·g (ε ≈ 1e-6·T·S_total), and use small, deterministic RNG seed tweaks; maintain the K-after selection with min_kvpr as a tie-breaker. Compare candidates using lexicographic KVPR vectors (sorted descending across GPUs) rather than scalar max only, then apply a cheap pre-refinement: try moving the top-2 w items from the worst GPU to the GPU with the largest nonnegative K that fits before the full move/swap loop. This combination improves robustness and often shaves the peak KVPR without runtime spikes.
