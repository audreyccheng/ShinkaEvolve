# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy KVPR-Minimizing Model Placement**

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Tight slack-equalization around a KVPR target T decisively outperformed transformed packing. The current best program (Balanced-Slack KVPR Minimizer, combined score 36.90, 0.002s) and its sibling Slack-equalization KVPR placement with refinement (36.90, 0.002s) explicitly equalize per-GPU KV slack K_g = T·S − (ΣR_g + T·used_mem_g) and place each item on the GPU that minimizes nonnegative K_after. This alignment between the decision rule and the objective is the clearest driver of the +10.7 score gap over the 26.xx cluster (e.g., Gens 51–54, 57–58 at 26.24; Gen 56 at 26.17).
- Compact multiplicative T search plus a small neighborhood delivers both quality and speed. The best program finds the first feasible T via multiplicative sweep (growth=1.08) from strong lower bounds, then probes a narrow neighborhood {0.985, 0.99, 1.0, 1.005, 1.01, 1.02}×T_feas and the midpoint. This matches earlier winning behavior and explains the 0.002s runtime (vs 0.03–0.05s for many binary/exponential search pipelines).
- Focused, bounded refinement on the worst GPU consistently trims the peak quickly. The best program’s local search (moves and limited swaps; move_budget≈18–20, swap_budget≈8–10) reliably reduces the measured max KVPR with negligible overhead, outperforming heavier search (e.g., 2-opt/eject-chains) used elsewhere without score gains.
- Strong lower bounds tighten T and prune search. The best program computes per-item, global, pair (filtered to top-200 by size), and k-prefix (k≤4) bounds, mirroring other top performers that achieved perfect success and fast convergence (e.g., Gen 50–54 variants).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Transformed-weight packing with binary/exponential T search plateaued despite rich heuristics. Multiple programs that center on w(T)=n+T·m and bisection/exponential search consistently scored ~26.24 (Gen 51/52/53/54/57/58, 0.032–0.052s) or 26.17 (Gen 56, 0.003s). Even with regret-based insertion and 2-opt, the decision rule is less aligned with minimizing the true max KVPR than slack-equalization, limiting quality.
- Heuristic complexity without direct T-feasibility alignment didn’t break the 25–26 band. Multi-stage hybrids and extensive variant exploration (e.g., Gen 52 and 53 at 26.24 with 0.047s) added runtime but did not improve the combined score over simpler, aligned methods.
- Indirect or partial slack handling underdelivered. Programs that relied primarily on transformed-space BFD or regret insertion, even with strong lower bounds and local search, did not match the 36.90 cluster, confirming that equalizing K_after is the key differentiator (e.g., Gen 50 at 25.76; Gen 56 at 26.17).

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Decision rule directly tied to T-feasibility: At placement time, pick GPUs that minimize nonnegative K_after = K_g − (dR + T·size). This ensures per-step decisions reduce the worst-case KVPR, explaining the large score jump (36.90 vs 26.xx).
  - Compact multiplicative T discovery with a tiny neighborhood: Growth=1.08 starting from tight bounds, then probing a handful of nearby T values, balances solution quality and speed (0.002s), outperforming binary/exponential searches that required more iterations (0.03–0.05s) without quality gains.
  - Strong bounds and safe numerics: Per-item/global/pair (top-200)/k-prefix bounds, epsilon guards, and robust slo==0 handling maintained 100% success across all programs while shrinking the feasible T region and avoiding false infeasibility.
  - Targeted local search: Short move/swap loops constrained to the worst GPU cut the peak KVPR at very low cost, beating heavier local search variants that didn’t improve scores.
- Effective coding patterns seen across high performers:
  - Deterministic small randomization among near-ties (seeded RNG) to break degeneracy without losing reproducibility (best program).
  - Multi-ordering tries with measured max-KVPR selection (w_desc, intrinsic_desc, density_desc) to diversify initial packings before refinement (best program and Gens 51–54, 57–58).
  - Greedy max-KVPR-increase fallback ensures reliability for edge cases and contributes to the perfect success rate (best program and Gen 55/59).

## Performance Analysis
- Two clear clusters emerged: slack-equalization methods achieved 36.90 (Gen 55 and 59, 0.002s), while transformed packing and hybrids clustered around 26.24 (Gens 51–54/57/58, 0.032–0.052s) or 26.17 (Gen 56, 0.003s) and 25.76 (Gen 50, 0.011s). The best program thus improved combined score by roughly +10.7 vs the 26.24 cluster, while also cutting runtime by an order of magnitude.
- Runtime vs score: The best method is both faster and better. Despite Gen 56 reaching 0.003s using a parametric BFD refinement, its score (26.17) remains far below 36.90, indicating that alignment with the T-feasible slack structure, not just speed, dictates quality.
- Consistent success and robustness: All listed programs achieved 100% success, but only slack-equalization produced a markedly higher combined score, reinforcing that feasibility is not the bottleneck; decision policy is.
- Local search impact: Many mid-20s programs used moves/swaps/2-opt (e.g., Gens 51–54), yet didn’t surpass 26.24. The best program’s bounded, worst-GPU-focused refinement achieved superior quality with minimal budgets, underscoring that targeted refinement after aligned initial placement is sufficient and more effective than heavier global improvements.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Pre-place memory-only (slo==0) models before slack equalization with per-GPU residual capacities
   - Split items into M0 = {slo==0} and M+ = {slo>0}. Place M0 by largest-size-first onto GPUs with the most remaining memory (pure memory balancing), update per-GPU capacities Sg and freeze them; then run assign_balanced_slack only on M+ using per-GPU Sg and initialize K_g = T·Sg. Recompute lower bounds on the residual instance (using S_total = ΣSg and total_size/total_R from M+) to avoid inflating T and eliminate the current dR==inf guard that triggers fallbacks.

2. Strengthen lower bounds and add an early jump within the multiplicative T sweep
   - Add a light triplet bound over the top P=120 models by size: for each pair (i,j) in the top-P, scan k in top-8-by-size and if si+sj+sk > (k−1)·S, set T ≥ (ri+rj+rk) / (k·S − (si+sj+sk)) when the denominator > 0. Extend the k-prefix bound to k up to min(gpu_num, 6) and tighten the pair bound by restricting to pairs where max(si,sj) ≥ 0.55·S to keep it cheap. In find_first_feasible_T, maintain max_lb = max(lb1, lb2, lb_pair, lb_k, lb_triplet) and, if the current T < max_lb, jump T = max_lb immediately to skip unproductive iterations.

3. Adaptive T retuning mid-placement with residual bounds and minimal disruption
   - During assign_balanced_slack, after placing about 40% of items, recompute a residual lower bound using the remaining items and the current per-GPU residual capacities; if residual_lb > T·1.02, set T’ = residual_lb, recompute residual weights w = dR + T’·size, re-sort the remaining items by w, and continue. If K-variance across GPUs remains high after ~75% of items, do a second, lighter retune: update T in-place (no reordering), recompute w only for decision checks and tie-breaks, and continue. This keeps the decision rule aligned with the evolving feasible region without adding extra outer-loop search.

4. Add a hybrid choose_rule J and evaluate it alongside the tight K-after rule
   - Define J = K_after_norm + α·kv_new_norm + β·mem_imbalance, where K_after_norm = K_after/(T·S), kv_new_norm = kvpr(sum_R+ dR, S−(used+size))/max(T,1e-12) clipped to [0,1.5], and mem_imbalance = (mean_used − used_dst)/S. Use α=0.15, β=0.05 by default; when var(K)/(T·S)^2 < 0.02, raise α to 0.25 to emphasize local KVPR control near convergence. For each T candidate, try both choose_rule='tight' and choose_rule='J' with seeds=1–2 and keep the best measured max KVPR; retain the deterministic RNG and the existing near-tie randomization.

5. Upgrade local refinement with donation-first moves and size-binned swaps focused on the worst GPUs
   - Replace the current uniform move/swap scan with: (a) donation-first moves from the worst GPU to the top-2 best GPUs by KVPR, scanning only the 12 largest and 12 highest-dR items on the worst GPU, committing the single move that minimizes the resulting global max KVPR; (b) if no move helps, do 2-opt swaps via 8 size bins to quickly find near-size pairs that fit and reduce the max; (c) if still stuck, try a final dual-worst interchange between the two worst GPUs. Keep tight budgets (move_budget=24, swap_budget=12), rollback non-improving steps, and stop early after two consecutive non-improving passes. This preserves speed while consistently trimming the peak KVPR beyond the current bounded refinement.
