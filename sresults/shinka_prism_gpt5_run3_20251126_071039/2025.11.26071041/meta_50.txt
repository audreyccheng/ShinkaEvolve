# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy KVPR-Minimizing Model Placement**
- **Implementation**: Greedily sorts models by r_j/s_j (req_rate/SLO) descending and assigns each to the GPU with the lowest current weighted_req_rate/remaining_mem among those with enough free memory (80GB per GPU), updating per-GPU totals after placement. It fails fast by raising an error when a model cannot fit, and does not implement a τ-feasibility check or post-placement ratio evaluation.
- **Performance**: Combined score 21.89; max_kvpr 20.892; success_rate 1.000; execution_time 0.000s.
- **Feedback**: The simple ratio-based balancing yields consistently feasible placements with near-zero runtime and strong KVPR results on the evaluator. Potential improvements include choosing GPUs based on the projected ratio after placement, adding τ checks, and avoiding a fixed 80GB assumption to better generalize and further reduce peak KV pressure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Slack-equalization around a KVPR threshold T dominates when tightly integrated with placement decisions. The current best program (Balanced-Slack KVPR-Minimizing GPU Placement, combined score 36.51, 0.002s) directly equalizes per-GPU KV slack K_g = T·S − (ΣR_g + T·mem_g) and selects GPUs that minimize nonnegative K_after for each placement, yielding a large margin over all other methods (which cluster near 26).
- Compact multiplicative T search plus a small neighborhood beats binary/exponential searches. The best program finds the first feasible T via multiplicative sweep (growth=1.08) from tight lower bounds, then probes {0.99, 1.0, 1.005, 1.02}·T_feas and the midpoint; this matches previously identified top-performers and explains the superior 36.51 score and 0.002s runtime. By contrast, multiple bisection-based pipelines plateaued (e.g., Gen 42/44/45 at 26.17).
- Targeted, bounded local refinement focused on the worst GPU is consistently effective. The best program applies capped moves and swaps (move_budget=20, swap_budget=10), echoing strong mid-tier performers that trimmed peak KVPR with minimal cost (e.g., Gens 43 and 49 at 26.24).
- Strong lower bounds tighten T and reduce search. The best program computes per-item, global, pair (size-pruned top-200), and k-prefix (k≤4) bounds to seed and prune T, an approach repeatedly associated with robustness and speed across variants (e.g., Gen 41 at 25.60; Gen 47 at 26.23).

## Ineffective Approaches
- Transformed-space BFD pipelines with binary/exponential search plateaued in the mid-20s even with rich heuristics. Programs that primarily use w = dR + T·size with bisection and variant exploration consistently scored ~26 (e.g., Gen 42/44/45 at 26.17; Gen 47 at 26.23), indicating a persistent gap vs slack-equalization.
- Heuristic complexity without alignment to the T-feasibility structure underdelivered. The annealed hill-climbing/SA approach (Gen 46, 23.68) and the heavier multi-stage hybrids (e.g., Gen 41, 25.60 with adaptive retuning and variant exploration) did not match slack-equalized methods, mirroring earlier findings that added machinery doesn’t translate to lower max KVPR when the core decision rule isn’t T-aware.
- Partial or indirect slack equalization didn’t break out of the 25–26 band. Even a slack-equalization variant (Gen 48, 25.59) fell short of the top cluster, likely due to broader hybrid scoring and assumptions (e.g., fixed GPU_MEM_SIZE and attribute-based constraints) diluting the tight K_after decision rule seen in the best program.
- Early balanced-slack variant underperformed substantially (Gen 40, 20.45) despite using K_g and w = dR+T·size, suggesting that two-phase T updates and heavier local search (including eject chains) are not substitutes for the best program’s compact multiplicative T sweep and tightly scoped refinement.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Tight T control: multiplicative sweep from strong bounds plus testing a compact T neighborhood balances feasibility discovery with quality, avoiding the iteration overhead of binary search while stabilizing solutions.
  - Decision rule aligned with the objective: assign to the GPU minimizing nonnegative K_after, with tie-breakers by min local KVPR or memory slack and tiny, deterministic randomness among near-ties (seeded RNG) to improve tie resolution without losing reproducibility.
  - Focused refinement: a short, worst-GPU-targeted move/swap loop with budgets (20/10) trims the global max KVPR cheaply; strict feasibility checks (memory and KVPR) are performed after packing and refinement to avoid costly repairs.
  - Practical lower bounds: per-item, global, pair (filtered to top-200 by size), and k-prefix (k≤4) bounds seed T and prune search, consistently driving speed and reliability across evaluations.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Pre-place memory-only (slo==0) models before slack equalization. Implement a first phase that assigns all slo==0 models by largest-size-first to GPUs with the most remaining memory (pure memory balancing), freeze them, reduce each GPU’s residual capacity S_g accordingly, and then run the balanced-slack packer on the remaining models. Recompute all lower bounds on the residual instance (per-item, global, pair, k-prefix) so T isn’t inflated or blocked by the current dR=inf guard.

2. Strengthen bounds and early-jump inside the multiplicative T sweep. Add a light triplet bound over the top P=120 models by size by checking O(P^2) pairs combined with k from the top-8 (only if si+sj+sk > (k-1)·S to prune), and extend the k-prefix bound to k up to min(gpu_num, 6). During find_first_feasible_T, track max_lb = max(lb1, lb2, lb_pair, lb_k, lb_triplet) and immediately set T = max(T, max_lb) when the sweep falls below it to skip iterations and stabilize T_feas.

3. Add adaptive in-placement T retuning with residual bounds. After placing roughly 40% of items, recompute a residual lower bound using remaining items and current per-GPU residual capacities; set T’ = max(T, residual_lb), rebuild weights w = dR + T’·size, re-sort, and continue. If K-variance across GPUs remains high after 75% of items, do a second, lighter retune (no reordering—just update T in-place) to correct mid-pack discretization without extra search.

4. Introduce a hybrid choose_rule J and evaluate it alongside the tight K_after rule. Define J = K_after_norm + α·kv_new_norm + β·mem_imbalance with α=0.15, β=0.05; when var(K)/(T·S)^2 drops below 0.02, raise α to 0.25 to emphasize local KVPR control. For each T candidate, try both choose_rule='tight' and choose_rule='J' (small seeds=1–2) and pick the better by measured max KVPR; keep the same deterministic RNG to retain reproducibility.

5. Upgrade local refinement with donation-first moves and size-binned swaps. After initial placement, repeatedly: (a) attempt “donations” from the worst GPU to the top-2 best GPUs by scanning a capped set of its items (e.g., 12 largest and 12 highest dR) and selecting the move that minimizes resulting global max KVPR; (b) if no move helps, try 2-opt swaps using size bins (e.g., 8 bins) to quickly find near-size pairs that fit and reduce the max. Keep tight budgets (e.g., move_budget=24, swap_budget=12), rollback any non-improving step, and add a final “dual-worst interchange” attempt between the two worst GPUs to harvest stubborn improvements.
