# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Greedy KVPR-Minimizing Model Placement**

- **Performance**: Combined score 25.79; max_kvpr 24.785; success_rate 1.000; execution_time 0.005s.
- **Feedback**: Passes all validation tests; the multi-start plus local refinement strategy achieves strong KVPR minimization with high robustness and very low runtime. Fallback strategies and careful tie-breaking improve feasibility and stability across diverse model sets.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Direct slack-equalization around a KVPR target T delivered the largest quality jump and the fastest runtimes. The current best program (“Model placement algorithm for minimizing maximum KV cache pressure across GPUs,” score 36.90, 0.002s) places each item on the GPU that minimizes nonnegative K_after = K_g − (dR + T·size), aligning the decision rule with the T-feasibility structure. Earlier slack-equalization also outperformed transformed packing (e.g., “Balanced-Slack KVPR Model Placement,” 29.35, 0.006s), confirming the pattern.
- Compact multiplicative T discovery with a tiny neighborhood outperformed binary/exponential searches. The best program uses a growth factor of 1.08 from strong lower bounds to find T_feas, then probes a short neighborhood {0.985–1.02}×T_feas plus the midpoint, achieving 0.002s vs 0.046–0.050s seen in parametric-transformed pipelines (e.g., “Min-Max KVPR Placement” variants at 26.24).
- Focused local refinement on the worst GPU with small budgets is both effective and cheap. The best program’s bounded move/swap loop (move_budget≈18–20, swap_budget≈8–10) consistently trims peak KVPR at negligible cost, beating heavier multi-operator local search used by mid-20s programs that did not yield higher scores.
- Strong lower bounds tightened T and improved robustness. The best program computes item/global/pair-prefix bounds (pair filtered to top-200 by size; k-prefix up to 4), mirroring other high performers; this accelerates feasibility discovery and supports the 100% success rate.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Transformed-weight packing with binary/exponential T search plateaued in the mid-20s despite rich heuristics. Multiple such programs scored ~26.24 (“Min-Max KVPR Placement with Parametric and Local Search,” 26.24, 0.049s; “Min-Max KVPR GPU Placement,” 26.24, 0.046s; “KVPR-Minimizing Multi-GPU Placement via Parametric Packing,” 26.22, 0.009s) and 25.79–24.98 in related variants (Gens 68/69). Their decision rule is less aligned with minimizing the true max KVPR than slack-equalization.
- Added heuristic complexity without T-feasibility alignment did not break the plateau. Techniques like donation-first refinements, 2-opt, and broad candidate variant coverage (e.g., Gens 60–61, 67–69 at 24.98–26.24) increased runtime modestly but did not close the gap to slack-equalization (36.90).
- Fragile LNS implementations caused outright failures. “Greedy LNS KVPR GPU Placer” (0.00, 0% success) had a syntax error (“del sel[k:] if …”) and risky slo==0 handling; “Greedy-LNS KVPR Placement” (0.00, 0% success) combined strict preplacement exceptions with a hardcoded 80 GB capacity likely misaligned with evaluator assumptions, leading to zero pass rate.
- Partial slack handling underdelivered. Beam/greedy hybrids without explicit K_after equalization (e.g., “Beam search model placement minimizing KVPR,” 22.96, 0.008s) were fast but lagged significantly in score, reinforcing that direct T-feasibility alignment is decisive.

## Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best program effective:
  - Decision rule: assign_balanced_slack uses K_g = T·S − (ΣR_g + T·used_mem_g) and places items to minimize nonnegative K_after, directly controlling the max KVPR at placement time.
  - T search: find_first_feasible_T uses a multiplicative sweep (growth=1.08) from tight lower bounds (item/global/pair top-200/k-prefix), then evaluates a tiny T neighborhood; this cut iterations and runtime versus binary/exponential searches used by 26.xx programs.
  - Bounded worst-GPU local search: local_refine applies short move/swap loops targeting the current peak GPU; this consistently lowers the measured max KVPR with negligible overhead.
  - Robustness features: deterministic small randomization for near-ties, strict feasibility/memory checks with epsilons, and a KVPR-minimizing greedy fallback ensure a perfect success rate.
- Effective coding patterns across high performers:
  - Multi-ordering tries with measured max-KVPR selection improves initial packings (best program tries w_desc/intrinsic_desc/density_desc/size_desc with tight or min_kvpr choices; similar patterns appear in Gens 60–61).
  - Candidate reduction and deterministic selection: deduplicating candidates and scoring by measured KVPR yields consistent improvements seen in the top programs.
  - Strong lower bounds are essential: per-item/global/pair/k-prefix bounds consistently shrink the T search space (best program; Gens 60–61, 67).

## Performance Analysis
- Two clear score clusters: slack-equalization dominates with the best program at 36.90 (0.002s) and a prior slack-based variant at 29.35 (“Balanced-Slack KVPR Model Placement,” 0.006s), while transformed-packing variants cluster around 26.24 (“Min-Max KVPR Placement with Parametric and Local Search,” 0.049s; “Min-Max KVPR GPU Placement,” 0.046s) and nearby values (25.79–26.22).
- The best program improved combined score by roughly +10.7 over the 26.24 cluster, while also cutting runtime by an order of magnitude (0.002s vs ~0.046–0.050s). Even faster parametric variants (e.g., 0.009s) did not match the quality, underscoring that alignment with T-feasibility, not just speed, drives score.
- Local search impact: many 25–26 programs used broader local search (moves/swaps/2-opt), yet did not surpass the plateau. The best program’s bounded, worst-GPU-focused refinement proved sufficient and more effective.
- Robustness trends: All non-buggy programs achieved 100% success; failures were due to implementation errors or brittle assumptions (syntax error and hardcoded capacity with strict exceptions in Gens 64/66). Among correct solutions, slack-equalization explains the large score variance; feasibility is not the differentiator.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Pre-place memory-only (slo==0) models to unlock slack-equalization for the rest
   - Split models into M0 = {slo==0 or dR==inf} and M+ = others. Place M0 largest-first onto GPUs with the most remaining memory (break ties by least models), freeze per-GPU capacities Sg, recompute lower bounds on M+ using S_total’ = ΣSg and ignore M0’s rates, then run assign_balanced_slack on M+ with K_g initialized as T·Sg and memory checks against Sg. This avoids falling back to the greedy path in mixed instances and keeps the decision rule aligned with T-feasibility.

2. Tighten T lower bounds and jump early in the multiplicative sweep
   - Add a triplet bound over the top P=120 items by size: for pairs (i,j) where max(si,sj) ≥ 0.55·S, scan k in top-8-by-size; when si+sj+sk > (k−1)·S and k·S−(si+sj+sk) > 0, set T ≥ (ri+rj+rk)/(k·S−(si+sj+sk)). Extend the k-prefix bound to k ≤ min(gpu_num, 6). In find_first_feasible_T, maintain max_lb over {item, global, pair, k-prefix, triplet} and, if T < max_lb, set T = max_lb immediately to skip unproductive iterations.

3. Residual-aware T retuning mid-placement with minimal disruption
   - After placing ~40% of items, recompute a residual lower bound using remaining items and current per-GPU residual capacities; if residual_lb > 1.02·T, set T’ = residual_lb, recompute w = dR + T’·size, re-sort the remaining items by w (keep placed items fixed), and continue. Optionally do a second, lighter retune near 75% placed: update T in-place (no reordering), using T’ only for choose checks and tie-breaks. This keeps placement decisions aligned with the evolving feasible T without adding an outer search loop.

4. Micro-restarts with tiny K-slack noise and adaptive ordering at the best T
